                                        Media integration refers to the combining of different types
                                        of media during instruction and incorporating them into your
                                        lesson plan and making them part of the total instructional process.

                                        common-place on desk-top personal computer systems. In order
                                        for such facilities to be of use as intended, it is important
                                        that the different media are integrated so that users can use
                                        the computer to perform different roles.
