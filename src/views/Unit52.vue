                        Media integration refers to the combining of different types
                        of media during instruction and incorporating them into your
                        lesson plan and making them part of the total instructional process.

                        As we may be aware, multimedia facilities are now becoming a 
                        common-place on desk-top personal computer systems. In order 
                        for such facilities to be of use as intended, it is important 
                        that the different media are integrated so that users can use 
                        the computer to perform different roles.
