                        Technology is very crucial and essential in teaching
                        and learning. New technologies may refer to advanced
                        and upgraded modes of learning that you as a teacher may
                        use to encode messages or content to the learner. These new
                        technologies include Internet connected laptops, computers,
                        audio visuals, smart phones, tablets, projectors, etc. which can
                        be used in teaching and learning. This range of implements can aid
                        in extension of efforts to deliver information and further
                        facilitate proper, better, and easy learning strategies.<br /><br />

                        New technologies may also favour learners who are dispersed to
                        learn wherever they are at affordable costs. Students may not
                        have to travel from their places of residence to institutions or
                        learning centres for face to face sessions with lecturers.
                        They may learn online and submit their assignments there.
                        The new technologies can therefore be a key mediator between
                        the teacher and the learner to convey messages and exchange
                        them. Simulation, enactive and symbolic experiences can be
                        integral in this relation to teaching and learning when
                        technologies are used.<br />

                        The new technology therefore is very important in learning
                        because these new technologies such as I Pads, electronic
                        readers, smart boards and handheld dictionaries can present
                        information in many different ways. It can present information
                        visually, orally, and in different colours so that every
                        learner can benefit and learn through these new technologies.<br /><br />


                        On the other hand, Educational Technology as a field of
                        study continues to grow and evolve (Newby et al.; 2006).
                        Today, we see a number of trends that will help educators
                        project where the field is headed for the future. One of
                        these developments is the Internet.<br /><br />

                        <i>The growth of the Internet</i>: Today, we live in an era of global
                        computer interconnectivity that brings a whole world of information
                        to the personal computer user through computer networking and
                        telecommunication. By accessing the Internet, one can instantly
                        locate up-to-date information, communicate with others and explore
                        the far corners of cyberspace (Newby et al.; 2006:58). This has
                        created what is referred to as <kk><i>'information superhighway'</i></kk>.
                        Information superhighways can deliver vast amounts of information
                        to individuals at school, work and home.<br /><br />

                        The <kk><i>Internet</i></kk> is the vast collection of computer networks
                        that links millions of computers and tens of millions of
                        people worldwide. Computers on the Internet are linked together
                        by a maze of interconnections sort of like a spider's web.
                        This web is composed of many separately administered computer
                        networks with many different computers linked together.<br /><br />

                        <kk>Uses of the Internet</kk><br />
                        <kk>Electronic mail (e-mail)</kk><br />
                        Communication in the form of <kk>
                            <i>
                                electronic
                                mail (e-mail)
                            </i>
                        </kk> is one of the most widespread
                        applications of communication via Internet.
                        E-mail for example, allows messages to be
                        sent from one individual to the other or from
                        individual to groups.  A major advantage with
                        the e-mail is that it allows you to send even huge
                        files and documents as enclosures called
                        <kk><i>'attachments'</i></kk>
                        and you can send the same information to
                        different  people spread in different parts of
                        the world.<br /><br />

                        <kk>The World Wide Web</kk><br />
                        Information retrieval is another use of the
                        Internet especially for education. The <kk>
                            <i>
                                World Wide
                                Web (WWW)
                            </i>
                        </kk> consists of millions of sites with
                        information displayed in hypermedia format as
                        it supports formatted text, graphics, animation
                        and even audio and video.<br /><br />

                        Countless information resources (including text, graphics,
                        sound, and video) are stored on computers all over the
                        world in documents called <i><kk>web pages. A web site</kk></i> is a
                        collection of web pages that are maintained by an
                        organization, school, university, government agency,
                        company or individual. Each web page has a unique
                        Internet address called a <kk>
                            <i>
                                Uniform Resource
                                Locator (URL)
                            </i>
                        </kk><br /><br />.

                        Through the World Wide Web, a teacher can find
                        information on any topic and subject.  This is
                        making it possible for teachers and students to
                        access the most current information on any subject
                        and topic without having to rely on textbooks. This
                        has completely revolutionized the way we access
                        information. As teachers and students, we can now
                        create our own website where we can upload information
                        for students to access without having to print it for
                        them. To access the web, you need to use a software
                        programme known as a <kk><i>browser</i></kk>. A browser allows you
                        to navigate the web and control how web pages are
                        displayed. Popular web browsers include; <kk>

                        <kk>Distance learning</kk><br />
                        One of the greatest advantages offered by modern
                        electronic technology is the ability to instruct
                        and to communicate with people who are not physically
                        present in the same room/venue and at the same time.
                        Today, <kk><i>distance learning</i></kk> has become a popular term to
                        describe learning via Internet. Distance learning is
                        characterized by physical separation between the teacher
                        and the learners, an organized instructional programme,
                        use of technological media, and a two-way communication.
                        As a result, most distance learning programmes use a wide
                        variety of media configurations including; radio, telephone,
                        television, and computers.<br /><br />

                        <kk>Wireless technologies</kk> are making it possible for
                        people to use computers and the Internet without being
                        connected to a wired connection. Below is a discussion on
                        wireless technology .

                        Wireless data is advancing at a good speed as more companies
                        introduce more features for consumers and business users alike.
                        From ring tones to picture phones, from text messaging to hi-speed
                        wireless Web browsing, wireless data is making waves in both the
                        consumer and business marketplaces. Wi-Fi or Wireless Fidelity
                        refers to the <i>
                            technology surrounding the radio transmission
                            of internet protocol data from an internet connection wirelessly

                        Many of the new laptops and other technological gadgets
                        on the market now come with wireless technology. They include
                        Tablets, I pads and Smart Phones. This technology can be quite
                        user friendly to remote areas provided they are facilitated.
                        Wi-Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11b or 802.11a
                        to transmit data from the internet connection to the host computer
                        (e.g. your laptop). These technologies provide reliable and fast
                        wireless connectivity and to some degree a level of security.
                        A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other,
                        to the Internet, and to wired networks.
