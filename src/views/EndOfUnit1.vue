                                            In this unit we focused
                                            on understanding what
                                            educational technology
                                            was and we also defined some
                                            of the terms that are closely
                                            associated with educational technology.
                                            We went on to discuss why we need to study educational technology.
                                            We discussed the relationship between educational technology,
                                            communication and learning. We need to understand where educational
                                            technology features or fits in, in the whole classroom communication
                                            process since we use educational technology to extend and maximise our
                                            communication efforts
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="text-justify">
                                            We also discussed the communication process in relation to learning
                                            as well as the various theories of learning.  It is important that we
                                            understand how learning takes place so that we can plan for effective teaching
                                            and learning. We concluded the unit by discussing the changing role of a teacher
                                            in classroom communication as newer technologies invade the classroom.  With this introduction,
                                            you now need to synthesize the knowledge gained into your own personal view of the teaching and
                                            learning process so that you can determine how educational technology fits into your teaching and learning.
