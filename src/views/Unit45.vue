                    In this section we will discuss how to select and use
                    other types of media besides printed media. From our discussion
                    in Unit 2, you probably still remember that we have many different
                    types of media that we could use during instruction. What is important
                    is being able to select the right type of media, and using it to meet
                    our instructional goal. Since we cannot discuss how to select all the
                    different types of media that we identified in Unit 2, we will select
                    a few to use as examples.

                <p class="text-justify meme">
                    Selecting the best medium or media for instructional purposes is not
                    an easy job. This is due to the fact that choices are complex and
                    difficult because they are based on a combination of interrelated
                    factors such as: the abilities and learning needs of the students;
                    the nature of the subject matter, the expected learning outcomes,
                    the range of media available, as well as making a choice from the
                    various alternative media available. However, there are some
                    guidelines you could make proper selection.

                    <i>Step- by - step process in media selection</i><br /><br />
                    For you to select the most appropriate instructional media during
                    the lesson, you will need to follow the following steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>

                            Determine whether the purpose of your lesson is to transmit
                            information or instruction. When a lesson involves transmission
                            of information, the learners are not held responsible for measurable,
                            specific actions or performance since the content is presented to give
                            an overview of ideas, subject matter, to generate interest or to provide
                            background information.  When a lesson involves instruction, learners are
                            required to give demonstrable proof that they have learned and they are
                            held responsible for the success of the lesson.  Both of these categories
                            have sufficiently different characteristics to suggest that different
                            media might be justified.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Determine the transmission method.  This focuses on the methods used to transmit
                            the content to the learners. The most dominant methods are; direct instruction,
                            indirect instruction, interactive instruction, and individualized instruction.
                            In most cases, direct and indirect instruction are teacher-centered approaches
                            and the most commonly used media are those which are teacher controlled while
                            interactive and individualized instruction which are learner-centered are best
                            presented using instructional media that are learner controlled.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Determine the lesson characteristics. Once you have formulated the
                            lesson objectives, the learning outcomes are determined and this
                            helps you in deciding on the learning experiences that will be
                            organized for the students. The learning experiences help in
                            selecting the types of media to be used.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Select an initial class of media. The selection of the media format
                            depends on certain practical considerations with respect to media
                            characteristics. Each type of medium has a number of characteristics,
                            including special capabilities and limitations, according to the quality
                            and type of communication you are expecting of it. For example, some media
                            are capable of presenting information in graphic form, others are also able
                            to communicate using graphics, but can also add an element of motion. Other
                            media are especially made to provide sound, while other media tend to engage
                            the learners more easily than others. Some media are economical in presenting
                            verbal information, while others are convenient to produce, modify and revise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Analyse media characteristics. You need to refer to your initial choice of media
                            and review the list of unique characteristics of each medium, its advantages and
                            disadvantages for presenting that particular lesson content. This helps you to
                            review your media selection and to refine the selection by either retaining the
                            same media selection or reconsider your decision. If you decide that the initial
                            media selection is no longer appropriate, then you have to go back and select
                            another media format.

                    <kk>General principles of media utilization</kk><br />
                    Brown et al. (1973:27) proposed some general principles in media use which are useful
                    in media-selection and decision-making. These principles should guide us as we select
                    and use media. These principles include that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            No one medium is best for all instructional purposes.
                            The best choice of media depends on what type of media
                            shows best the principle being taught. For example, if
                            the third dimension plays an important part in communicating
                            your message, then you should expect better results from a model.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Media uses should be consistent with lesson objectives.

                        <li>
                            Users must familiarize themselves with media content
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Media must be appropriate for the instructional format.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Media must be adaptable to student capabilities and learning styles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Media are neither good nor bad simply because they are concrete or abstract.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Media should be chosen objectively rather than on the
                            basis of personal preferences or bias.

                            There are several points to consider when selecting and using different instructional materials.
                            The discussion that follows will address that.  <kk>Three -dimensional materials</kk><br />
                            Do you still remember that we did touch upon three- dimensional media
                            earlier on? Write down what you can recall. Three-dimensional materials
                            include; models, specimens, mock-ups, dioramas, and exhibits. Like all
                            other instructional materials, three-dimensional teaching materials will
                            not be effective unless they are used properly as part of a well-thought-out
                            teaching strategy. You need to follow some basic guidelines in their use.
                            The following guidelines are necessary:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Be sure everyone can see them. All visuals materials being used
                                    with a group must be visible. They should be large enough to
                                    be seen easily by everyone in class.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Use three-dimensional materials in combination with other media.
                                    For example, when you use a model of a flower to explain pollination
                                    in a Biology class, you could use a large chart to show the details
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Practice using the materials before the class.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <kk>Community resources</kk><br />
                            Did you know that the community has a wide variety of resources you could
                            utilize for teaching and learning? Community resources include; places within
                            the community, people, and activities and objects that are found within the
                            community.

                <p class="text-justify meme">
                    <i>People as a resource</i><br />
                    People as a resource for learning consist of professionals and
                    experienced groups. To utilize people as learning resources
                    requires proper planning. Planning entails:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Specifying the instructional objectives.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Interacting with the person either formally or informally to
                            establish whether they will live up to the expectations of your students.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Invite the person formally to class and brief them on : the level of
                            the class, their interests, the learning objectives, the students'
                            expectations, time allowed for the presentation,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Introduce the person during the presentation and be present throughout the presentation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Include a question or discussion session.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Organize a follow-up activity after the presentation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify meme">
                    <i>Activities as a resource</i><br />
                    Activities could include; agricultural show, trade fair, exhibition,
                    religious gathering, visiting speaker, a function etc. Community activities
                    are tricky to use because they are completely out of your control as the teacher.
                    Therefore, it is important that you familiarize yourself with the contents of
                    the activity by either; attending the event prior to taking your students,
                    reading from brochures, newspapers, talking to the organizers, etc.
                    In case you decide to take the students to the activity, brief them
                    about what to look for and ask them to prepare a brief report of what
                    they saw and learned. Also if you cannot take the students, you could
                    attend the event, collect relevant literature, record the proceedings,
                    etc., and then make a presentation to your students personally.<br /><br />

                    <i>Places as a resource</i><br />
                    Places refer to locations within the community which might contain facilities
                    that could be used to demonstrate certain concepts and ideas. These could include;
                    irrigation projects, factories, markets, landforms, institutions, etc.  Trips are
                    organized to places where students can see in practice or in reality what they have
                    studied in class.  Note that Dale's cone of Experience places field trips towards
                    the middle of the cone (See sub-section 2.2.2 - Role of Media in Teaching and Learning)
                    because though the experience is real, students are only seeing and hearing but not
                    directly manipulating them. Once students undertake such trips, concepts and
                    generalizations that were difficult to formulate become clearer. Study trips
                    can be organized in any subject area for any level of students. For more
                    information on field trips, refer to school guidelines
                    (If already a practicing teacher) or access information from the Internet.<br /><br />

                    <i>Objects as a resource</i><br />
                    Objects refer to things that are found within the community which could be used to yield
                    certain learning outcomes. Objects include; artifacts, specimens, coins, etc. The procedure
                    for utilizing objects is similar to that of other media, though as a teacher you need to
                    develop the habit of collecting them from community and building a resource pool for such
                    objects so that you can select and use them at your convenience.<br />
                    To utilize community resources in general, the following procedure should apply:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Plan for the use of any community resource whether people,
                            activities, places or objects. Planning involves formulating
                            an instructional goal and stating the learning outcomes/objectives
                            to be achieved by using the identified community resources.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Know the types of resources available in your community.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Consider the use of other media such as photographs, maps, video and audio recordings, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Always include follow-up discussions for students to reflect on their learning experiences.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p class="text-justify meme">
                    Two-dimensional visuals include pictures and graphics. Generally
                    two-dimensional visuals such as diagrams are often abstract and
                    require special background knowledge to read them. When considering
                    such visuals, a teacher needs to ask himself/herself two questions.
                    First, is the visual illustration necessary at all? Second, if it is
                    necessary, how much does the visual contribute to the understanding of
                    the content/concept or process being taught?<br /><br />

                    Graphics help to synthesize information and highlight significant elements
                    and should be used after the content/concept has been introduced.

                <p class="text-justify meme">
                    A display is an organized arrangement of visual and verbal learning
                    materials that presents significant information or ideas on a topic
                    or theme.  A display might involve the use of either two or three
                    dimensional materials such as diagrams, photographs, graphs, or
                    objects and specimen.

                            could include newspaper and magazine articles,
                            photographs, graphs, charts, objects, specimen, etc.
                            make sure that the materials provoke further questions in the
                            students'/viewers' mind. The materials collected should
                            complement each other and enhance an overall effect.

                        <li>
                            Plan a layout of the display. Attributes of a good display
                            layout include: the display should communicate one central
                            idea so keep it simple, use colour wisely, use appropriate
                            headings and captions, use good lettering, and involve the
                            viewers (Wittich & Schuller, 1979:130-135).

                    As you preview the materials, decide how you are going to use
                    the materials, how the students will be involved, and what
                    follow-up activities to use.<br /><br />

                    <i>Prepare the Materials</i><br />
                    Before using audio materials for group presentation, practice
                    operation of the equipment. Cueing the material is important
                    to avoid delays and lost time. Prepare your introduction and
                    follow-up. If there are other materials to be used along-side
                    with the audio materials, be sure to practice first.<br /><br />

                    <i>Prepare the Environment</i><br />
                    Set up the classroom or learning environment so that all students
                    can hear the audio tape. For a large audience, avoid using a small
                    audio cassette recorder/playback. Make sure that you use good quality
                    speakers that do not distort the sound.<br /><br />

                    <i>Prepare the Learners</i><br />
                    Before playing the audio material, communicate to students
                    how the material relates to what they have studied before,
                    what they should learn from the materials, and what follow-up
                    activities will be used. If new vocabulary, or technical terms
                    are going to be presented, list them on the chalkboard, handout
                    or overhead transparency and define/ explain them before students
                    listen to the audio materials.<br /><br />

                    <i> Provide the Learning Experience</i><br />
                    Engage learners in activities during the presentation to
                    help in learning transfer. Let students carry out certain
                    learning activities as they listen. Develop audio learning
                    skills by engaging students in activities that force them to
                    listen attentively to the presentation through tasks based on
                    what they listen to and hear from the audio presentation.
                    One way of doing this is to give students a set of questions
                    to answer as they listen to the audio tape.<br /><br />

                <p class="text-justify meme">
                    First you need to evaluate the purpose for which the materials
                    are to be used and then select the type of material to accomplish this purpose.<br /><br />

                    The first step in selecting still projection materials is deciding whether a particular
                    material serves a specific teaching purpose better than another medium or device.
                    In this case, consider the unique properties of that particular medium. The five basic
                    questions to ask include

                            Is motion necessary for students' understanding
                            of the concepts to be learned? If so, then still
                            projection media are not the best.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Are suitable materials available
                            for my particular teaching purpose?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Does what I am teaching involve a
                            series of step-by-step developments or a fixed
                            logical progression? If so, transparency overlays will be the best choice
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do I need materials that tell a story through pictures?
                            If so, still projection will be necessary.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Is speed or other aspects of timing important in my teaching goal?

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify meme">
                    After selecting the type of still projection to use, then prepare
                    for the presentation. At this stage, you need to become fully acquainted
                    with the key points to be highlighted for the students. This should happen
                    when you preview the still projection.<br /><br />

                    The next step is to prepare the class by explaining to them why they are viewing
                    that particular presentation. Let students understand clearly what to look for from the projection.<br />
                    Next, make the presentation and involve the students in the actual use of media. Finally, provide some
                    follow-up activities that allow students to evaluate demonstrate and apply what they have learned.

                    <i>Prepare the environment</i><br />
                    Make sure that the venue for viewing the video and film is properly set, in terms of seating
                    arrangements, lighting, and sound production.<br /><br />

                    <i>Prepare the learners</i><br />
                    Let students see how the day's lesson links up with previously
                    covered content. Create a need to know among the students. Stimulate
                    curiosity by asking questions that students would like answered from the
                    video or film. Clarify the objectives of the lesson. Mention specific things
                    to look for from the presentation. If a lot of content will be presented, give
                    students some advance organizers.<br /><br />

                    <i>Provide the learning experience</i><br />
                    Observe for learner reactions. As students watch the video or film, provide
                    for learner participation. Engage students in activities that would assist in learning transfer.

                    Computer-based hypermedia can be applied in all areas of the curriculum for
                    any learning goal that is suited to individual or small group exploration of
                    a body of information. Teachers can either adapt existing materials or create
                    new materials to fill a need of their own students. Just like with other media,
                    to select and use computer-based multimedia, you need to start by analyzing the
                    audience so that whatever materials you select are able to meet the learning needs
                    of the students. Questions you should ask yourself are: <i>

                    Currently the buzz word when it comes to web learning is E-learning or sometimes called
                    Online Learning. Through computers and other gadgets (including mobile devices) one is able
                    to learn while away from the instructor or facilitator. You may have had experience on this
                    through this course. Below we briefly look at E-learning.<br /><br />



                    <kk>What is e-learning?</kk><br />
                    E-learning has come to define  any dissemination of educational knowledge over the Internet.
                    This makes e-learning a subset of technology-based training. It also incorporates a number of learning
                    activities conducted on the Internet, of which mobile learning is one part.

                    <kk>Differentiating e-learning from mobile learning</kk><br/>
                    E-learning can be real-time or self-paced, also known as "ynchronous" or
                    "asynchronous" learning. Additionally, e-learning is considered to be
                    "tethered" (connected to something) and presented in a formal and structured manner.
                    In contrast, mobile learning is often self-paced,
                    un-tethered and informal in its presentation.

                    Because mobile devices have the power to make learning even
                    more widely available and accessible, mobile devices are considered 
                    by many to be a natural extension of e-learning (Ellis, 2003). We
                    have come to the end of the unit. Before you proceed go through the summary
