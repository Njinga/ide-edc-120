                            For teachers to adapt their instruction to changing
                            times and environments, they need to have a thorough
                            working knowledge of the many kinds of educational
                            technologies available that might assist in teaching
                            and enhance learning. Educational technologies are the
                            tools that a teacher might need to use in order to
                            create an effective instructional event.

                            You need to note that it is not any media that you use that can
                            perform the required instructional role. Research indicates that
                            most media can perform most instructional functions to a certain
                            extent (Aronson, 1977; Briggs, 1968; Briggs & wager, 1981; Clark & Salomon, 1986).
                            According to Gagne, Briggs & Wager (1988), most writers on media selection models
                            agree that there is no one medium that is universally superior to all types of
                            desired outcomes and for all learners.  However, some media are better at
                            doing certain things than others and no single medium can be best for all
                            instructional situations. We therefore need to use a variety of media
                            during instruction. So, the million dollar question to ask then is,
                            <i>'what medium or media shall I use in my lesson?'</i>

                            As you begin your instruction, it is important to select a medium
                            that will enhance your lesson by ensuring optimal use of the media.
                            To select the most appropriate medium/media for your lesson, you will
                            need to ask yourself several questions. The following questions can guide
                            you in selecting the most appropriate media during instruction:

                            Below we will try to answer each one of the questions above.

                            You will need to use media if it will assist you to achieve your
                            lesson objective(s). Remember that media can be used at the introduction
                            to a lesson, during the lesson, or when concluding the lesson.

                            Whenever you select to use media during the lesson, remember
                            that the media has a specific role to play in that lesson.
                            Your role is to help students learn by utilizing the media
                            that you will have selected.  Active learner participation
                            enhances learning and the most effective learning situations
                            are those that require learners to perform some activities
                            building towards the lesson objectives.
                            According to Romiszowski (1988:62), media
                            selection is based on two classes of media
                            characteristics. These are the essential media characteristics
                            that control the clarity of the message, and optional media characteristics
                            that improve the quality of presentation.  Each type of media has a set of
                            advantages <c>(e.g. motion, realism, sound)</c> <i>and a set of educational limitations</i>
                            <c>(e.g. room size, group size).</c>

                            In selecting the right media, two main steps have to be followed.
                            The first step is to determine your instructional goal(s) and secondly,
                            you must select the most appropriate media to meet the instructional goal(s).

                            Whenever you select media, it is important to consider how the
                            different media present the required stimuli for learning.
                            For example, do your students need to observe in detail the
                            phenomena being studied?  Is sound necessary for understanding?
                            Are there certain inside details that the learners need to
                            observe in order to understand how something functions or operates?
                        </p>

                            Below are the major factors that you will need
                            to consider whenever you select media for instruction:<br /><br />

                            <kk>Instructional Objectives</kk><br />
                            Your awareness of the expected learning outcomes influences the
                            choice of media. Before selecting any instructional media, always
                            ask your-self this question; <i>
                                'What type(s) of media can help me to
                                produce the behaviour required from the learner at the end of the
                                instructional process?'

                            The media that you select to use should suit the content to be delivered.
                            If for example you are teaching a lesson in Geography that focuses on World
                            Climates, you will need to use a world map to help the learners locate the
                            different regions of the world that are influenced by the different climates.
                            If you are teaching a lesson in Biology on blood circulation, you might need
                            to use a model so that students can observe the interior of the model to
                            understand how blood flows to and from the heart.

                            If in your lesson you would like the students to work together and share experiences,
                            then you cannot use a one directional medium such as audio media. Alternatively,
                            if students have to learn a certain skill and demonstration is necessary,
                            then you will need to use real media or simulations.

                            The learning tasks facing the learners influence the choice
                            of media.   For example, what type of skill do you want the
                            learners to acquire? Is it observational skills? In such a case,
                            you will need to use descriptive visuals that answer the question;
                            <i>'What do you see?'</i>

                            As you select media, you need to have a good knowledge of
                            the target audience or students. You need to know your students in terms of:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <i>How many are they?</i> You cannot hold a single photograph
                                    in front of a class with forty students and expect all
                                    of them to view it clearly from their seats.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    What <i>are their entry competencies/prior knowledge/assumed knowledge?</i>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i> What are the students' preferred learning styles?</i> Some learners
                                    depend more on language or spoken word to learn, others depend on
                                    visualization, others on hands-on experiences, while others depend
                                    on logical reasoning and experimentation.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i>What is their background experience?</i> If learners are entering
                                    a new conceptual area for the first time or they are meeting the content
                                    for the very first time, they will require direct and concrete experiences.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Learner's social-cultural background- It is important to consider the learner's
                                    cultural background when selecting media because some media are interpreted
                                    based on the audience cultural experiences.
                                </li>

                                    Unique learner characteristics- Learners in class might have some very unique
                                    characteristics.  For example, learning disability. It would be unrealistic
                                    to use printed materials with a group of slow learners since this would
                                    create more problems for them.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i>How old are the learners?</i> Age influences choice of media since it is
                                    related to their experience.
                                </li>

                            Media have different properties. Some media allow us
                            to transport events through time such as photographs,
                            some media create motion, and some allow interior
                            details to be observed, while other media can be
                            transported through space and reproduced anywhere,
                            such as radio and Television broadcasts allowing
                            information from a central place to be heard.
                            These are the qualities of media that we need
                            to exploit when selecting media. Each type of
                            media has certain unique advantages, which makes
                            it more suitable in meeting certain instructional
                            goals compared to others.

                            You can only use media if it is available when needed.
                            There are certain media that you might want to use but
                            you might not, either because they are not available
                            when you need them, or it is too expensive to purchase.
                            It could also be because you lack the technical capability
                            to use the media.

                            <kk>Teachers' attitudes towards media</kk><br />
                            If the teacher has phobia of a certain media, he/she is
                            unlikely to use it even when it would be the best
                            alternative for the given instructional situation.
                            Usually, attitude is linked to teachers' lack of
                            skills needed to use that particular media.
                            It is common to find that teachers will occasionally
                            choose media when it fits their teaching habits,
                            skills and preferences. For instance, teachers
                            born before the computer age might not want to
                            even learn how to use a computer because they
                            associate it with generations that came after
                            them. They will stick to using print media
                            even where the computer would do a sterling job.

                            As you select the media, also ask yourself the following question:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Will the media selected accomplish the defined task?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Is the media of the correct level of understanding for the class?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Will the media help you to achieve the expected learning outcomes?
                                </li>

                            </ul>
                            The above criteria should guide you as you select your
                            instructional media for any instructional situation.
