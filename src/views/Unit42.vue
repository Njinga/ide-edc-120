                        Instructional design is the component of the process that helps you to think
                        strategically about the teaching and learning experience you are targeting.
                        It helps you to articulate every essential ingredient in the teaching-learning
                        process. It paints the bigger-picture version of instruction that results in a
                        complete and precise blueprint of what should happen and how.<br />
                        Designing instructional materials deals with creative thinking and an analysis
                        of how the creative thinking process is successfully used. What is also revealed
                        is the fact that most often three steps are followed. These steps include:

                    </p>

                                the planning stages of audience identification, objective statement, and content listing.

                                <i>Manipulation: </i>Play with a number of ideas to devise one or more possible solutions
                                or to find a new pattern of treating the content that differs from that which
                                has been familiar (Kemp & Dayton, 1985).

                        </ol>
                        In designing your own instructional media, you will be guided by three main questions:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme font-italic">
                        <ol>

                            <li>What will the media do for the students?</li>
                            <li>How do I prepare for the use of this media?</li>

                        As you answer each of the above questions, you will
                        be guided in your design of the right instructional
                        media to use in order to meet your instructional goal.

                        <i>Start the process with an idea.</i>  An idea, a problem situation,
                        or a learning need identified within an instructional-design plan for
                        a topic or unit of study should be the starting point for the development
                        of your instructional media. An idea indicates an area of interest but the
                        more useful ideas are those conceived in terms of a need relating to a
                        specific target group. In our case as teachers, our students' need for
                        certain information or for a skill, or the need establish a desired attitude.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Creation of instructional media by you as a teacher could be
                        influenced by any one of the following intentions that might be
                        served by media when you use it either with individuals, small
                        groups, or with large groups:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme font-italic">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Motivate an interest or a degree of action</li>
                            <li>Present information;</li>
                            <li>Provide instruction.   </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Now let us consider each purposes in more detail.<br /><br />

                        For <kk>motivational purposes</kk>, dramatic or entertainment techniques may be employed.
                        The desired result is to generate interest or stimulate learners to take certain action.
                        This should involve accomplishing objectives that affect personal attitudes, values, and emotions.<br /><br />

                        For <kk>informational purposes</kk>, the instructional media would be used
                        in a presentation made before a group of learners. The content and form of
                        the presentation would be general in nature, serving as an introduction,
                        an overview, a report, or background knowledge. It could therefore employ
                        either entertainment, dramatic, or motivational techniques in order to attract
                        and hold learners' attention. Usually, when viewing informational-type materials,
                        the individuals tend to be passive viewers or listeners.<br /><br />

                        For <kk>instructional purposes</kk>, while presentation of information is important,
                        attention is also given to involving the participants or the students in our case in
                        either mental or overt activities relating to the instructional media being used so that
                        learning can take place.  The materials themselves should be designed more systematically
                        in terms of learning principles in order to provide effective instruction but at the same time,
                        they should be enjoyable and provide pleasant experiences. It is desirable to make provision for
                        the individual learner to use instructional media on their own.

                    </p>
                    <div class="note note-secondary text-justify meme">
                        Once you have formulated an idea, <i>
                            you need to build on that idea by translating the
                            general idea into clear-cut and specific statement of one or more objectives for the
                            planned learning within an instructional context.

                        learn in a particular lesson. This is stated in terms of
                        instructional/learning objectives. Instructional/learning objectives
                        provide clear guidance that allows an orderly presentation of content leading to learning.<br /><br />

                        To provide for the desired learning, objectives are stated to indicate the outcomes of the learning.
                        Objectives are grouped into three broad categories, namely; cognitive which focuses on knowledge and
                        information and is represented by thinking and other intellectual skills, psychomotor which focuses on
                        performance skills, and affective which focuses on attitudes and values.<br /><br />


                        Depending on the content to be taught, you formulate objectives
                        to address each one of the broad learning domains.    For example,
                        you might state your instructional objectives to address the following learning outcomes:

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Help learners to apply certain steps in a given process;</li>
                            <li>Help learners to practice a certain skill or attitude</li>
                            <li>Help learners to respond to a certain social need.  </li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Your design process should also consider the audience or the learner.
                        You need to be aware of the learner characteristics such as age, educational
                        level, knowledge of the subject matter, attitudes towards the subject, cultural
                        context of the learners, the number of learners in class, and individual differences
                        within the group.  Audience characteristics influence you as you consider the ideas to be
                        presented, level of learner involvement, and degree of participation.<br /><br />

                        Finally, obtain assistance from persons who have special knowledge and skills
                        relating to the materials being developed or on similar developed materials.
                        Such people might include computer experts, communication specialists, or instructional designers.<br /><br />

                        Please note that just like there is no single recipe to creating effective instruction,
                        there are different ways of creating learning experiences. However, the following
                        procedure could guide you in this process.<br /><br />

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Refer repeatedly to your instructional plan. The lesson
                                plan contains the direction and activities that you have
                                determined your students need.

                                Within the plan, look closely at the overall learning objectives
                                and the key activities that need to occur so that students meet them.
                                Ask yourself the question: <i>
                                    'What needs to be constructed so that the
                                    activities are successful?'
                                </i> For example, <i>
                                    'Do my students need some explanation,

                                Reflect on what you know or have seen. For instance, <i>
                                    Can I talk to a teacher who has
                                    taught similar concepts before?

                                Put yourself in the learners' shoes. <i>
                                    What would I want to experience
                                    in order to effectively learn the materials?

                                Outline the materials. Have students review what you have thought.
