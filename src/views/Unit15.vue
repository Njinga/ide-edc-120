                                        To understand how technology fits into instruction, we need first to have a
                                        clear picture of the nature of teaching,
                                        learning, and the instructional events that
                                        teachers construct for transferring information and skills to their
                                        students. As a teacher, you need a clear understanding of key teaching and
                                        learning theories. Since this module cannot provide you with that information,
                                        it is suggested that you refer to the relevant sections in your module on <strong>

                                        One of the things that you might have noted from your reading is the definition of terms like "teaching" and "learning".
                                        Nacino-Brown et al (1982:2) have defined teaching as <i>
                                            "an attempt to help someone acquire, or change some skills, attitude,
                                            or knowledge".
                                        </i>In other words, the teacher influences
                                        desirable change in the behaviour of the learner.
                                        The goal of teaching is to bring about desired learning in
                                        the student. The aim of teaching is to help individuals learn.
                                        Teaching can also be defined as a systematic, planned sequence of
                                        events that facilitates the communication of ideas, concepts or skills
                                        to a learner (Lever-Duffy, J.; McDonald, J.B.; Mizell, A.P. (2005).
                                        The act of teaching requires an understanding of learning and of
                                        the individual as well as understanding of environmental factors that affect the learner.
                                        This calls for imagination on the part of the teacher by selecting relevant content, using
                                        the most effective methods and materials and organizing the learning the environment in a way
                                        that learners interact with the content and helps to bring about the desired behaviour.

                                        Learning on the other hand is something that takes place in an
                                        individual's mind. It can never be seen or observed directly.
                                        Learning is said to have occurred whenever an individual's
                                        behaviour is modified or when a person thinks and acts differently,
                                        or when he/she has acquired new knowledge or a new skill
                                        (Kemp & Dayton, 1985:13).  According to Heinich et al (1996),
                                        <i>
                                            learning is the development of new knowledge, skills, or attitudes as an
                                            individual interacts with information and the environment.
                                        </i>

                                        The instructional/learning process involves the selection, arrangement, and
                                        delivery of information in an appropriate environment and the way the
                                        learner interacts with that information. Usually the arrangement of
                                        information and the environment is normally the responsibility of the
                                        instructor and the designers of instructional media.  As a teacher, you need
                                        to select, arrange, and deliver the information in an appropriate
                                        environment so that learners can interact with it and convert it into
                                        knowledge.

                                        For instruction to take place, instructional media are used since they form part of
                                        the instructional environment.   If you can recall, we gave a simple definition of
                                        education technology as <i>
                                            any technology used by educators in support of the teaching

                                        The best way for students to learn is for them to experience the environment firsthand.
                                        However, it is not always possible to provide learners with firsthand experience as the
                                        environment becomes more complex and some compromise in form of substitute experience
                                        must be developed.  The teacher will need to select and use appropriate media that could
                                        provide substitute experience.  Therefore, instructional media form part of the classroom
                                        communication process and play a vital role in the learning process.

                                        Earlier on, we defined instruction as the arrangement of information and environment to
                                        facilitate learning. That transmission or transfer of information from a source to a
                                        destination is called <strong>communication</strong>.   Since new learning usually depends on taking
                                        in new information, effective instruction cannot take place unless communication takes
                                        place. Therefore, we need to understand the communication process so that we can use
                                        educational technology effectively during instruction.

                                        The word 'communication' has its origin from a Latin word, <i>"communis"</i> which means,
                                        <i>"make common"</i>. This could be stretched to mean, 'create a common ground for understanding' or
                                        share with others an idea, concept, or information. Communication could also be defined as
                                        <i>an attempt to persuade people or influence them with intent</i>. Communication is the process
                                        through which information is passed from one person to another.

                                        As a teacher, you are basically a communicator. You have ideas and information to
                                        share with your students so that they know these. You need to make a deliberate effort
                                        to influence the students to perceive the ideas and information the same way you do.
                                        This means that you have to follow a process that will help you to share the ideas and
                                        the information with your students. That process is called communication.

                                        As mentioned previously, communication is the process through which ideas, information,
                                        or skills are passed from a source to a receiver as intended. Communication does not
                                        occur unless the person receiving the message interprets it as intended. This means that
                                        both the source and the receiver must share a common understanding of the message when
                                        communication takes place.   Communication as a process consists of several elements.
                                        These elements include:

                                        To encode the message and convey it as intended to the target audience,
                                        the source must have the following characteristics:

                                                composition (either homogenous or heterogeneous group), ability level, specific entry competencies, size (how many), their experience

                                        <kk>The receiver</kk> is the person who decodes/interprets the message.
                                        As the person encoding the message, make sure that you reach out
                                        to your target audience since whatever message you encode must be
                                        interpreted by the target audience as intended. For example, you talk
                                        and your audience listens, or you write and they read the content of the
                                        message. Make sure that your message is rooted in their experiences.
                                    
                                    </p>

                                        <kk>The message</kk> refers to the content that you are communicating to the audience.
                                        The message could be facts, information, skills, etc.  You should organize the
                                        message in a way that interests the audience and which they can identify with.
                                        Make the message credible and put it at the level of your audience understanding
                                        so that they can easily interpret it. The message should be receiver oriented.

                                        <kk>The channel or the medium of communication</kk> is the means used to encode the message.
                                        The medium could be spoken word, a picture, a chart, a machine, music or a combination
                                        of any of such media.  The channel that you choose to use to convey your message affects
                                        how the message is received and interpreted by the audience or the receiver.
                                        It is said that 'the medium is the message' because the channel that you select
                                        determines how effectively the audience receives the message. Media serve as extensions
                                        of our efforts to communicate with the target audience. Therefore, always select the most
                                        appropriate channel by considering the following factors:

                                        <kk>The environment</kk> refers to the context of communication or where communication takes place.
                                        This could be the classroom, the laboratory, the workshop, or in the open field.
                                        So, make sure that you select media/medium that fits the situation.

                                        <kk>Feedback</kk> refers to knowledge of results based on the receiver's
                                        response to the message sent. Whenever you communicate, you need
                                        to confirm whether the message has been received as you intended.
                                        You should not wait to be told by the receiver whether the message
                                        has been received as intended or not. You should look for feedback
                                        and it does not always have to be verbal or spoken.  Feedback could
                                        be in form of words, expressions, gestures, or other actions (verbal and non-verbal).
                                        Feedback could also be positive or negative.  As a teacher, always be aware of the non-verbal
                                        feedback. As it is said, <i>
                                            <kk>'one cannot not communicate'</kk>.  This means that communication is always on going,
                                            it is also irreversible, irretrievable, and interdependent. What I say, or not say, or what I do, affects
                                            how you respond and what you say or do affects me but neither of us determines the behaviour of the other.
                                        </i><br /><br />

                                        Feedback helps you as the source of the message to detect where a problem might have arisen if
                                        the message has not been received as intended. It also helps you to correct any errors in the
                                        transmitted message, or to improve the encoding and transmission process or even to assist your
                                        target audience if they have a problem interpreting the message. Do not always wait to receive
                                        feedback. Look for it from your audience especially by observing the non-verbal communication cues.

                                        An additional element in a communication process is noise. Noise is any disturbance that
                                        interferes with or distorts the transmission of the message.  Noise could have a serious
                                        impact on the success or failure of communication. Noise clouds and masks information transmission
                                        to varying degrees and must be recognized as an obstacle to be overcome (Kemp & Dayton, 1985).

                                        clear and precise communication does not always occur.
                                        There are three types of variables that might interfere
                                        with the communication of ideas namely;

                                        <kk>Environmental factors</kk> are those factors within the environment
                                        that cause a learner to lose focus and disengage from active
                                        participation in the communication process. Such factors could
                                        include; loud noise from outside the classroom, excessive movement, poor lighting,
                                        or poor seating arrangement. This could also be caused by poor physical reception.
                                        Clear understanding of the message depends on clear, unhampered and undistorted
                                        reception of the message. For example, written words or drawings must be large enough

                                        Inaccurate reading of feedback could also cause this to happen.

                                            In your answer you need to establish the connection between learning theories
                                            and the application of educational technology. This requires you to explain what
                                            the various learning theories say about how individuals learn, and what should happen
                                            for the individual to learn. Then, go on to explain the role of educational technology
