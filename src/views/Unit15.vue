                              To understand how technology fits into instruction, we need first to have a
                              clear picture of the nature of teaching,
                              learning, and the instructional events that
                              teachers construct for transferring information and skills to their
                              students. As a teacher, you need a clear understanding of key teaching and
                              learning theories. Since this module cannot provide you with that information,
                              it is suggested that you refer to the relevant sections in your module on <strong>
                                  Teaching
                                  Principles and Practice.

                              One of the things that you might have noted from your reading is the definition of terms like "teaching" and "learning".
                              Nacino-Brown et al (1982:2) have defined teaching as <i>
                                  "an attempt to help someone acquire, or change some skills, attitude,
                                  or knowledge".
                              </i>In other words, the teacher influences
                              desirable change in the behaviour of the learner.
                              The goal of teaching is to bring about desired learning in
                              the student. The aim of teaching is to help individuals learn.
                              Teaching can also be defined as a systematic, planned sequence of
                              events that facilitates the communication of ideas, concepts or skills
                              to a learner (Lever-Duffy, J.; McDonald, J.B.; Mizell, A.P. (2005).
                              The act of teaching requires an understanding of learning and of
                              the individual as well as understanding of environmental factors that affect the learner.
                              This calls for imagination on the part of the teacher by selecting relevant content, using
                              the most effective methods and materials and organizing the learning the environment in a way
                              that learners interact with the content and helps to bring about the desired behaviour.

                              Learning on the other hand is something that takes place in an
                              individual's mind. It can never be seen or observed directly.
                              Learning is said to have occurred whenever an individual's
                              behaviour is modified or when a person thinks and acts differently,
                              or when he/she has acquired new knowledge or a new skill
                              (Kemp & Dayton, 1985:13).  According to Heinich et al (1996),
                              <i>
                                  learning is the development of new knowledge, skills, or attitudes as an
                                  individual interacts with information and the environment.

                              The instructional/learning process involves the selection, arrangement, and
                              delivery of information in an appropriate environment and the way the
                              learner interacts with that information. Usually the arrangement of
                              information and the environment is normally the responsibility of the
                              instructor and the designers of instructional media.  As a teacher, you need
                              to select, arrange, and deliver the information in an appropriate
                              environment so that learners can interact with it and convert it into
                              knowledge.

                              For instruction to take place, instructional media are used since they form part of
                              the instructional environment.   If you can recall, we gave a simple definition of
                              education technology as <i>
                                  any technology used by educators in support of the teaching
                                  and learning process.

                              The best way for students to learn is for them to experience the environment firsthand.
                              However, it is not always possible to provide learners with firsthand experience as the
                              environment becomes more complex and some compromise in form of substitute experience
                              must be developed.  The teacher will need to select and use appropriate media that could
                              provide substitute experience.  Therefore, instructional media form part of the classroom
                              communication process and play a vital role in the learning process.

                              Earlier on, we defined instruction as the arrangement of information and environment to
                              facilitate learning. That transmission or transfer of information from a source to a
                              destination is called <strong>communication</strong>.   Since new learning usually depends on taking
                              in new information, effective instruction cannot take place unless communication takes
                              place. Therefore, we need to understand the communication process so that we can use
                              educational technology effectively during instruction.

                              The word 'communication' has its origin from a Latin word, <i>"communis"</i> which means,
                              <i>"make common"</i>. This could be stretched to mean, 'create a common ground for understanding' or
                              share with others an idea, concept, or information. Communication could also be defined as
                              <i>an attempt to persuade people or influence them with intent</i>. Communication is the process
                              through which information is passed from one person to another.

                              As a teacher, you are basically a communicator. You have ideas and information to
                              share with your students so that they know these. You need to make a deliberate effort
                              to influence the students to perceive the ideas and information the same way you do.
                              This means that you have to follow a process that will help you to share the ideas and
                              the information with your students. That process is called communication.

                              As mentioned previously, communication is the process through which ideas, information,
                              or skills are passed from a source to a receiver as intended. Communication does not
                              occur unless the person receiving the message interprets it as intended. This means that
                              both the source and the receiver must share a common understanding of the message when
                              communication takes place.   Communication as a process consists of several elements.
                              These elements include:

                              has been received as intended or not. You should look for feedback
                              and it does not always have to be verbal or spoken.  Feedback could
                              be in form of words, expressions, gestures, or other actions (verbal and non-verbal).
                              Feedback could also be positive or negative.  As a teacher, always be aware of the non-verbal
                              feedback. As it is said, <i>
                                  <kk>'one cannot not communicate'</kk>.  This means that communication is always on going,
                                  it is also irreversible, irretrievable, and interdependent. What I say, or not say, or what I do, affects
                                  how you respond and what you say or do affects me but neither of us determines the behaviour of the other.
                              </i><br /><br />
                              Feedback helps you as the source of the message to detect where a problem might have arisen if
                              the message has not been received as intended. It also helps you to correct any errors in the
                              transmitted message, or to improve the encoding and transmission process or even to assist your
                              target audience if they have a problem interpreting the message. Do not always wait to receive
                              feedback. Look for it from your audience especially by observing the non-verbal communication cues.

                              An additional element in a communication process is noise. Noise is any disturbance that
                              interferes with or distorts the transmission of the message.  Noise could have a serious
                              impact on the success or failure of communication. Noise clouds and masks information transmission
                              to varying degrees and must be recognized as an obstacle to be overcome (Kemp & Dayton, 1985).

                              clear and precise communication does not always occur.
                              There are three types of variables that might interfere
                              with the communication of ideas namely;
                              <kk>environmental factors, psychological factors, and personal filters.</kk>

                              <kk>Environmental factors</kk> are those factors within the environment
                              that cause a learner to lose focus and disengage from active
                              participation in the communication process. Such factors could
                              include; loud noise from outside the classroom, excessive movement, poor lighting,
                              or poor seating arrangement. This could also be caused by poor physical reception.
                              Clear understanding of the message depends on clear, unhampered and undistorted
                              reception of the message. For example, written words or drawings must be large enough
                              for all students in class to see and read from every corner in the classroom.

                              that define and affect the reception of the communication message. For example,
                              an individual's emotional state at the time the message is transmitted.
                              Inaccurate reading of feedback could also cause this to happen.

                              If one for example holds a belief that is directly opposed to the content of the message,
                              then the information might be distorted to be consistent with the belief or rejected because it
                              is in conflict with the belief.

                              <i>In your answer you need to establish the connection between learning theories 
                              and the application of educational technology. This requires you to explain what 
                              the various learning theories say about how individuals learn, and what should happen 
                              for the individual to learn. Then, go on to explain the role of educational technology 
                              in fulfilling that role of helping individuals learn. In particular consider the suggestions
                              made by Kemp, & Dayton, (1985:14) about some important factors that we need to consider in
