                            In this unit, we have discussed how to integrate instructional
                            media during instruction. One of the things we have noted in
                            this unit is that generally some teachers do not integrate
                            media into their lessons. The main reason because of limited
                            or no training on media integration. We also discussed at
                            length how you can integrate the computer into teaching and
                            learning. Remember that in order to effectively integrate the
                            computer, we need to be very clear of the intended role of the
                            computer during instruction.   We have noted that the first thing
                            to consider in that process is to consider your instructional objectives.
                            Then ask yourself the question; "What is it that I want  my students to
                            learn and how can the computer be of benefit?"
