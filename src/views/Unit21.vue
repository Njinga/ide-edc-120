                        In this unit, we will discuss the different media available
                        for teaching and learning.   This unit will explore both the
                        traditional and the current technologies that we could use to
                        enhance teaching and learning. We will also look at the
                        advantages and disadvantages of using the various instructional
                        media for teaching and learning and discuss the trend in the use
                        of media and technologies so that we are prepared for the changes
                        that are likely to occur in teaching and learning.

                        carry out on your own. Again you are requested to
                        ensure that you actually carry the activities out
