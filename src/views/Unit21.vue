                                        In this unit, we will discuss the different media available
                                        for teaching and learning.   This unit will explore both the
                                        traditional and the current technologies that we could use to
                                        enhance teaching and learning. We will also look at the
                                        advantages and disadvantages of using the various instructional
                                        media for teaching and learning and discuss the trend in the use
                                        of media and technologies so that we are prepared for the changes
                                        that are likely to occur in teaching and learning.
