                                        As we have indicated above, media should not be seen as an appendage but an integral
                                        part of your lesson. You need to conceive the media that you intend to use as part of
                                        your whole lesson. In that case, plan when to use media in your lesson and how it will
                                        be used and include it into your lesson plan. Since in a lesson plan you specify the teacher
                                        and learner activities; indicate what will be the role of the teacher as well as the role of
                                        the students when the media is used.  Also specify when a particular media will be used.
                                        This helps you as a teacher to prepare the media and to plan both the teacher and learner
                                        activities prior to using the media.
                                    </p>

                                        This suggests that as you state the lesson objectives, you need to specify the intended
                                        application of instructional media to the different types of learning outcomes; i.e. cognitive,
                                        affective, or psychomotor depending on the role that you want the media to play in your lesson
                                        and the outcomes that you wish the students to achieve by using the selected media.
                                        Different types of media help us to achieve the cognitive, affective and psychomotor
                                        learning domains to varying degrees. So, be sure what type of learning outcome you would
                                        like the selected media to achieve in your lesson.

                                        Before selecting and using the media always ask yourself the question;
                                        <i>"What is it that I want my students to learn and how can media help?</i>
                                        After selecting the media, you again need to ask yourself the following questions;
                                        <i>
                                            "What will be the role of media during the lesson? At what point of the lesson
                                            will the media be used? What will be my role  and that of the students as the media
                                            is being used?
                                        </i>

                                        The next thing that we discuss in this section is how to integrate the computer
                                        into the teaching/learning experience. The computer which is a commonly used media
                                        technology, is used here as an example. The first thing to consider in this process
                                        is to consider your instructional objectives. Then ask yourself the question; <i>
                                            "What is it that I want my students to learn and how can the computer be of benefit?"

                                        In answering the above question, you need to note the role of a computer in a classroom setting.
                                        The computer can play different roles during instruction. The computer can be a <i>
                                            teacher,
                                            an assistant and also a learner
                                        </i>. In this case then it will be easier
                                        to integrate it into your lesson.
                                    </p>

                                        The oldest use of the computer in education dating back
                                        to early 1960s was as a tool that presents instruction directly
                                        to students (Newby at el., 2006).  Such is termed as <i>computer assisted instruction</i> (CAI),
                                        <i>computer-based instruction </i>CBI), or <i>computer-assisted learning</i> (CAL).
                                        In this mode, the computer can present instruction, use various media
                                        (text, graphics, audio, video, etc.), provide instructional activities or
                                        situations, or otherwise require interaction from learners, evaluate learners' responses,
                                        provide feedback, and determine appropriate follow-up activities.
                                        You should then use it in the appropriate events in the instruction.

                                        The chief advantage of the computer is its interactivity. The computer
                                        can demand active learner involvement, and when you use it as a teaching machine,
                                        the computer can be highly interactive, individualized, engaging, and infinitely

                                        or knowledge through repetitive work. The purpose is to give learners the opportunity
                                        to master the material at their own pace. Compared with non-computer drill and practice,
                                        the computer offers significant advantages:

                                                or wrong. Many drill and practice programmes automatically recycle missed items until they

                                        The computer becomes the learner and the student becomes the teacher. The objective

                                        This requires the student to apply programming language.

                                        When using the Internet, you have to be selective about the quality
                                        of what you might find since you have no control over what is uploaded
                                        onto the Internet. Guide your students wisely when searching for information
                                        on the Internet. You need to evaluate Internet information and control what
                                        type of information your students have access to.

                                            <li>
                                                <i>Consider the learner characteristics.</i>
                                                When using the Internet, consider the students'
                                                abilities to access the Internet for communication,
                                                information retrieval, and information publishing.
                                                If students do not have such skills, you will need to teach them.

                                                <i>Specify the instructional objectives</i>. You should only use the
                                                Internet if it will add value to your lesson.
                                                So consider why you want to use the Internet during the lesson.

                                                connection. The type of connection in your classroom or computer
                                                laboratory might limit your options. For example, dial-up

                                                While preparing the learning environment, check to confirm
                                                that the computers are working properly and have Internet access.
                                                Schedule the computer laboratory if you plan to have several students
                                                access the Internet at the same time. Confirm that the web sites that
                                                you want to use are available. Prepare the students for the lesson
                                                activity whether to be done individually, in small groups, or as a class.
                                                Provide written guidelines on the activities to be undertaken by the students.
