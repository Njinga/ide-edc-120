                        To assist in media selection decisions, media
                        selection models are used. Models consist of basic
                        elements that need to be taken into consideration
                        when choosing media. Several media selection models
                        have been used. Among them include what is called <kk>the basic model</kk>.

                    <h3 id="item-1-1" class="h3-responsive">3.4.1 The basic model </h3>
                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        This model is based on the application of a systems approach. A systems
                        approach is a procedural way of thinking about problems in education.
                        A systems approach can be defined as; <em>
                            'an overall approach that
                            involves tackling problems in a disciplined manner keeping priorities
                            in mind. The sub-system making up the overall system can be designed,
                            fitted, checked, and operated so as to achieve the overall objective
                            efficiently (Rowntree, 1974).
                        </em>
                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        A system can also be described as the sum total of interrelated parts
                        working together to form a complete whole. For example, a car or the
                        human body is a system. Even an institution like the University of Swaziland
                        (UNISWA) is a system.  A system contains certain elements; i.e. inputs,
                        outputs, environment, sub-systems, etc.  Any system receives inputs
                        from the environment and gives out outputs after they have been processed.
                        However, within a system, there are sub-systems which function independently
                        of each other. When the sub-systems combine together, they form a complete
                        whole. It is therefore argued, according to the systems thinking, that the
                        whole is greater than the sum total of its parts put together. Inputs,
                        outputs and processes are defined in relation to each other, as a change
                        in one will affect all other parts.<br /><br />
                        In a systems approach, each decision is justified in terms of pre-planned
                        objectives.

                            <li>
                                <em>Formulate goal/objectives</em> - (design stage). Based on what you want

                                write your goal and objectives. When writing objectives
                                take into consideration the knowledge, skills and attitudes
                                you expect learners to achieve. During this stage you also
                                begin designing your lesson plan.

                                develop or select the media that suites the learning outcome. E.g.,
                                if learners are going to be able to define "Volcano", the media you
                                choose to use should make it clear to the learners so that they are
                                able to define volcano. You could use a chart, a poster, a picture,
                                a video, etc.
                            </li>

                                into use by showing what you have developed or selected on your
                                lesson plan. However, before actual implementation you should
                                pre-test your materials to see if they will address the
                                learning outcomes. For proper implementation, refer also
                                to the ASSURE Model (see Section 3.5 ).

                        systems approach that we have discussed above. As we noted from the
                        systems approach, instructional planning needs to be systematic and
                        procedural. For example, to use instructional media effectively,
                        there must be a match between the characteristics of the learners
                        and the methods, media and materials. This can best be achieved by
                        applying the ASSURE Model which is a procedural guide for planning
                        and conducting instruction that incorporates media.

                        size of the audience, and any special learning needs.
                        Specific entry competencies refer to knowledge and skills
                        that learners either possess or lack such as pre-requisite
                        skills, and attitudes. Learning styles refer to the spectrum of
                        psychological traits that affect how we perceive and respond to
                        different stimuli such as anxiety, aptitude, visual or auditory
                        preferences, etc. Below, we are going to look closely at each analysis.

                        Analysis of the learner characteristics is helpful in selecting
                        instructional methods and media. For example, students with
                        substandard reading skills may be reached more effectively
                        with non-print media than with print. When teaching students
                        in Swaziland, use of materials that represent familiar cultural
                        identity will be more effective than when you use materials that
                        are completely foreign to them. When you are teaching students that
                        are entering a new conceptual area for the first time, direct and
                        concrete experiences such as field trips will be more effective.
                        Heterogeneous groups which include learners varying widely in their
                        conceptual sophistication or in amount of first-hand experience on a
                        certain topic will benefit more from an audio-visual experience
                        such as a videotape.

                        Students' prior knowledge of a particular subject influences
                        how and what they learn. This means that before you plan a lesson,
                        you need to verify the entry competencies of the learners, either
                        through informal means such as in-class questioning, or formally
                        through tests. Prerequisites refer to competencies that the learner
                        must possess in order to benefit from the instruction, competencies
                        that you or media are not going to teach. By analysing what the
                        audience already knows helps you to select appropriate methods
                        and media.

                        <kk>Learning styles</kk><br />
                        Learning style refers to students' approaches to learning,
                        problem-solving and processing information (Snow, Corno, & Jackson, 1996).
                        Learning style can also be defined as a cluster of psychological traits that
                        determine how an individual perceives, interacts with, and responds emotionally
                        to learning environments (Heinich et al., 1996:37).

                        Certain traits affect our ability to learn effectively from
                        different methods and media. However, it is not clear which
                        traits are most important.  Gardner (1993) who was dissatisfied
                        with the concept of IQ and its unitary view of intelligence identified
                        seven aspects of intelligence namely:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                verbal/linguistic (language)

                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        Gardner's view implies that teachers, curriculum planners
                        and media specialists should work together to design a
                        curriculum in which students have a chance to develop
                        these different aspects of intelligence. It also implies
                        that students vary widely in terms of their strengths and
                        weaknesses in each of these areas. The teacher should
                        ensure that students are engaged in a wider variety of
                        methods and media.

                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        One simple way of thinking about learning styles is to consider
                        the sensory channels that a student prefers for taking in new information-
                        visual, auditory, or kinesthetic.

                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        We need to note that students are not alike as they differ
                        from each other in terms of their sensory preferences.
                        Therefore, we should vary our instruction to accommodate
                        those differences.

                        Learning style variables can then be categorized into the following;

                            perceptual preferences and strengths, information processing habits,

                        Learners vary as to which sensory gateways they prefer using and which
                        they are especially adept at using. The main gateways include; <kk>
                            <em>
                                auditory,

                        in Unit 2, we noted that most of the information that we receive is obtained
                        through our sense of sight. This view was confirmed by Dale's Cone of experience.

                        This relates to how individuals approach the cognitive processing of
                        information. Gregorc's model "mind styles", elaborated by Butler (1986),
                        classify learners according to concrete versus abstract and random versus
                        sequential styles. The model yielded four categories namely:<kk>
                            <em>
                                concrete
                                sequential, concrete random, abstract sequential, and abstract random.

                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        Concrete sequential learners prefer direct, hands-on experiences presented
                        in a logical order.   They are best with workbooks, demonstration, and
                        structured laboratory exercises. Concrete random learners lean towards
                        a trial-and-error approach and reaching conclusions from exploratory experiences.
                        They prefer methods such as games, simulations, independent study projects and
                        discovery learning. For abstract sequential learners decoding verbal and
                        symbolic messages and readings as well as listening to presentations are
                        preferred methods. Abstract random learners have the ability to draw meaning
                        from human-mediated presentations as they respond to tone and style of the
                        speaker as well as the message. They do well in group discussion and
                        lectures with question-and-answer periods.

                        <kk>Motivational factors</kk><br />
                        Motivation refers to a process whereby a goal-oriented activity is instigated and
                        maintained. Motivation is a common influence on human activities. Motivation makes
                        direct contribution to learning by focusing students on certain desired learning
                        goals and increasing the effort they expend in reaching those goals (Newby et al., 2006).
                        Various emotional factors do influence what we pay attention to, how long we pay attention,
                        how much effort we invest in learning, and how feelings may interfere with learning.
                        Anxieties, locus of control, achievement motivation and competitiveness, are critical
                        variables to the learning process.<br />
                        Knowing something about your students' motivation will help with instructional
                        planning as it will help you to add to the extrinsic or intrinsic appeal of
                        instruction especially with regard to choice of instructional media.
                        For example, you might use curiosity by presenting students with a variety of
                        situations that are unique, surprising, or inconsistent with their existing ideas.

                        These are factors related to gender differences,
                        health, and environmental conditions. Boys and girls
                        respond differently to school experiences. For example,
                        boys tend to be more competitive and aggressive than girls
                        and consequently respond better to competitive games.

                        You are able to select media that are within the ability level of

                        to achieve. An objective is a statement of what each learner ought to get
                        out of the lesson. The statement of objective should be as specific as possible.
                        Statement of objectives influences the choice of instructional methods, media

                        starts by naming the <kk><em>Audience</em></kk> of the learners for whom the
                        objective
                        is intended, then specifies the  <kk><em>Behaviour</em></kk>  or capability to be demonstrated,

                        this module will not discuss objectives in detail. The behaviours

                        It answers the question - 'How well must students perform'.

                        We should emphasize here that an instructional objective is

                        at which it is aimed. All learning outcomes are classified

                            cognitive,

                        cognitive domain, learning focuses on intellectual capabilities,

                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        A systematic plan for using media demands that the methods,
                        media and materials be selected systematically.
                        The selection process has three steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li> Decide on the appropriate method for the given learning tasks </li>
                            <li>Choose a media format that is suitable for carrying out the method, and</li>
                            <li>Select, modify, or design specific materials within that media format.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        <em>Decide on a method</em><br />
                        Since no one single method can be appropriate for all instructional
                        situations, you will need to use more than one instructional method
                        during the lesson. For example, during the lesson introduction,
                        you might want to use a simulation activity to capture the
                        attention and arouse interest of the learners, but you might
                        use a demonstration to present the new information.
                        Finally you might arrange for drill-and-practice
                        activities to provide practice in the new skills.

                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        Choice of instructional method(s) should be determined by:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The nature of the subject matter,</li>
                            <li>The learning outcomes to be achieved,</li>

                            <li>The learning experiences to be organized for the learners.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        <em>Choosing a media format</em><br />
                        A media format is the physical form in which a message is incorporated
                        and displayed. Media formats could include; audio, video,
                        computer multimedia, still visuals (graphics, flip chart, etc.),
                        text, etc.  In Unit 2 of this module we discussed the various
                        types of media. Please refer to the relevant unit to remind
                        yourself about the different types of media that we identified.
                        Note that each media format has its unique strengths and limitations
                        which make it suitable for use in different instructional situations.

                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        One thing to note is that whenever you select media for teaching and
                        learning, you will need to consider certain factors.
                        Among those factors include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The learning goal and the instructional objectives to be achieved;</li>
                            <li>The learner characteristics;</li>
                            <li>The nature of the subject matter;</li>
                            <li>The unique media characteristics;</li>
                            <li>Practical constraints such as availability of media;</li>
                            <li>Technical ability /expertise of the instructor.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        <em>Obtaining specific materials</em><br />
                        Obtaining specific materials will generally involve one of three alternatives:
                        <ol>
                            <li>selecting available materials </li>
                            <li>modifying existing materials </li>
                            <li>designing new materials. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        When there are existing instructional materials that could allow the
                        students to meet their instructional objectives, such materials
                        should be used to save time and money.  However, when the existing
                        materials do not completely meet your objectives or are not entirely
                        suitable for your audience, an alternative approach is to modify the
                        materials. For example, you might select a video whose content might
                        not be suitable for your class but the visuals could be useful in
                        illustrating certain concepts that you would like the students to understand.
                        In such a case, you will remove the sound, and only select the relevant visuals to use.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        When modification of existing materials is not possible, then your final
                        alternative is to design and produce your own materials.
                        This is an expensive and time consuming process but it
                        allows you to prepare materials that serve your students
                        well and meet your objectives.  Unit 4 discusses how to
                        design and produce the various types of instructional
                        materials. You might need to refer to this unit in case
                        you decide to produce your own materials.

                        <kk>Selecting available materials</kk><br />
                        The majority of instructional materials used by teachers are "off the shelf"
                        as they are ready-made and available either in school or can be obtained
                        from organizations, institutions, libraries, resource centres, video
                        shops and publishers.   As a teacher, you need to be resourceful
                        enough to survey possible sources of media. For example, you could
                        request for media catalogues from the local publishers to identify
                        what types of materials are available in the various subjects offered
                        in your school.

                        If you are a science teacher, you could visit The Science Education

                        (UNISWA) which is managed by the Department of In-service within the
                        Faculty of Education. They have a collection of videotapes that could
                        be very useful in your teaching subjects.  Other places that you might
                        visit include the National Curriculum Centre, the Foreign Embassies
                        accredited to Swaziland, Government Ministries, United Nations Agencies, etc.

                        As a resourceful teacher, you need to build a collection of media materials
                        by creating a media centre where all relevant instructional materials that
                        you come across are filed and collected.

                        <em>Media selection criteria</em><br />
                        The decision on whether to use a certain instructional material or
                        not depends on several factors some of which we have already discussed.
                        Before you select a particular type of media material, you need to ask
                        yourself the following questions:

                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Does it match the curriculum content?</li>
                            <li>Is it accurate and current?</li>
                            <li>Does it contain clear and concise language?</li>
                            <li>Will it arouse motivation and maintain interest?</li>
                            <li>Does it provide for learner participation?</li>
                            <li>Is it of good technical quality?</li>
                            <li>Is a user guide or other documentation included?</li>
                            <li>Is the pace of presentation appropriate for the media? (Heinich et al.; 1996:47).</li>

                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        <em>Modifying available materials</em><br />
                        When you cannot locate entirely suitable materials and media off
                        the shelf, you might be able to modify what is available.
                        Say for example you have a videotape that shows a needed
                        visual sequence but the audio portion is inappropriate.
                        In such a case you could show the video with the sound turned off
                        and provide a narration yourself.  You can also use instructional
                        games to teach certain concepts by merely changing the rules of
                        play to increase or decrease the level of sophistication.

                        <em> Designing new materials</em><br />
                        There are times when you have no choice but to design new materials
                        that would suit your instructional objectives. Whenever you decide
                        to design new materials, consider the following design elements:

                        It is also important to preview the materials before

                        You need to prepare the media and the materials to support the
                        instructional activities that you plan to use.
                        This is necessary whether you are presenting the
                        materials or your students are using them.
                        First, gather the materials and equipment that you and your
                        students will need. Then determine the sequence in which
                        the media and materials will be used. Decide what you will do as
                        you present the materials and what the students will do. It might
                        be necessary to practice using the materials before actually using
                        them in class. For a student-centred lesson, ensure that the students
                        have access to all the materials, media and equipment that they will need.

                        For example, the seating arrangement, the lighting, and ventilation,
                        should be considered depending on the type of media being used.
                        In case you are using a videotape, all the students should be able
                        to view the presentation without being obstructed. Some of the media
                        require a darkened room, convenient power source and access to light switches.
                        <br /><br />
                        Before using any equipment, check to confirm that it is working.
                        In the case of the film or the overhead transparencies, ensure
                        that the light bulb is not blown-off. In case you want the students
                        to discuss the media after using it, arrange the seats so that
                        students can see each other as they discuss the topic.

                        <i>Prepare the learners</i><br />
                        What students learn depends on the how well they are prepared
                        for the lesson. Therefore, before using any media, prepare the learners.
                        What you could do to prepare the learners for the use of media may be to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide an introduction and give a broad overview of the lesson content;</li>
                            <li>Provide a rationale indicating how the lesson relates to the overall topic being  studied;</li>
                            <li>Tell students what to pay attention to as they use the media;</li>
                            <li>Direct the learners' attention to specific aspects of the lesson. </li>
                            <li>
                                If students do not have the prerequisite knowledge to understand the media being used,
                                provide some information to assist their understanding of the materials presented
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In case there are certain vocabularies that will be mentioned
                                and need to be explained, discuss them before presenting the media.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        <i>Provide the learning experience</i><br />
                        Whenever you use media and materials in a lesson, the purpose is to help students learn.
                        Therefore, provide opportunities for the students to engage in some learning experiences.
                        You should play the role of a guide to facilitate learning by helping students to explore
                        the topic, discuss the content, etc. The students should be actively involved in
                        the use of media and materials and not just be silent observers.
                        Provide activities for the students to engage in as you use the media and
                        materials in class.

                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        Active participation in the learning process enhances learning.
                        Cognitive theories of learning, which focus on internal mental
                        processes, have also supported the principle that effective
                        learning demands active manipulation of information by learners.
                        Gagne (1985),  concluded that there are several necessary conditions
                        for effective learning of each type of objective, but one condition that
                        pertains to all objectives is <i>'practice of the desired skill'</i>.
                        Therefore, the most effective learning situations are those that
                        require learners to perform activities that build toward the objective.
                        The form of participation could include; practising new spelling of words,
                        solving some mathematical problems, creating a product, observing some
                        visuals and interpreting them, etc. Discussions, short quizzes,
                        and application exercises can provide opportunities for practice and
                        feedback during instruction. Follow-up activities can provide further
                        opportunities for practice.

                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                        The final component of the ASSURE model for effective learning is evaluation and
                        revision. Evaluation as we know , is an on-going process and it can be done before,
                        during and after instruction. For example, before instruction, you might want to
                        find out whether learners have the necessary prerequisite knowledge to enter a new
                        learning experience especially with regard to the use of the planned media and materials.
                        You might also evaluate the media and materials before presenting it in class to confirm
                        that it will meet the learners' intended learning outcomes. During instruction, evaluation
                        is used in form of student practice of a desired skill, short quiz or self- evaluation.
                        Evaluation at this stage is mainly diagnostic to help detect any teaching/learning problems
                        and difficulties in the instructional process that might interfere with the attainment of
                        objectives.

                        <i>Evaluation of learner achievement</i><br />
                        The ultimate question in the instructional process is whether the students have learned
                        what they were supposed to learn (Heinich et al.; 1996:56).  Can they display the
                        capabilities specified in the original statement of objectives?  At this stage,
                        you want to assess whether the skills acquired by the learners meet this criterion.<br />
                        Evaluation of achievement depends on the nature of objectives. For example,
                        some objectives can be evaluated through written tests while others require
                        practical activities.

                        Evaluation should also include the assessment of instructional media and materials.
                        After using the media and materials, you need to reflect back and ask yourself
                        the following questions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Were the instructional materials effective?
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Could they be improved?

                            <li>
                                Were the materials cost-effective in terms of student achievement?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Did your presentations take more time than it was worth?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Were the materials interesting enough to motivate students?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Did the media and materials help students meet the objectives?

                        Alternative ways of evaluating media and materials include;
                        use of class discussions, individual interviews, and observation
                        of student behaviour.  These methods of evaluation might provide you
                        with information that you might not be able to capture from an
                        evaluation checklist.

                        results of your evaluation data gathering. You need to find out whether
                        there were any discrepancies between what you intended to happen and what happened.
