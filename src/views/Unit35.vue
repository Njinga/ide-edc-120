                        situations if you can locate them. Gaining access to the materials is not
                        difficult if you could have an idea where they could be found.  Possible
                        locations include:

                                <kk>At school.</kk> You need to develop a culture of collecting instructional
                                materials and building a collection of such resources in your school.
                                So check what types of resources your school might have accumulated over time.

                                <kk>In the neighbourhood.</kk> Identify potential sources of instructional materials
                                in the local area. These could be the University library, national libraries,
                                foreign embassies accredited to the country, international organizations,
                                National Curriculum Center, the Teacher Inservice Department, Government
                                Ministries and departments, etc. Your local daily newspapers are also a
                                potential source of instructional materials as they contain pictures,
                                photographs, and textual materials (articles) that could be of interest
                                in your subject.

                                materials. You could use search engines to search for the materials and to access
                                the various databases. Huge amounts of already prepared materials could be
                                located and you are no longer limited to textbooks and resources in the
                                library as the Internet makes available information resources from
                                around the world.

                                might be available for teaching in your subject. Also enrol and become a member of
