                        In this section you are introduced to the different
                        ways of utilising materials during instruction. One
                        thing to keep in mind at all times however is that
                        appropriate materials selected for a particular task
                        must be based on the objectives or what you would like
                        your learners to achieve at the end of the lesson. We
                        will discuss how we can make use of printed materials

                        In this section we are going to discuss how we can utilize printed materials
                        effectively during instruction. As we mentioned in Unit 2, printed materials
                        are among the most commonly used form of instructional materials in most classrooms.
                        In spite of the recent public fascination with new electronic media, it is unlikely
                        that printed materials will ever be eliminated as a vehicle of instruction and it
                        will always have an important role to play in instruction. Admittedly, the current
                        spreading trend towards electronic communication (e-mail systems, Database Networks,
                        and World Wide Web Hypermedia such as; Portable Document Formats (PDF), and Hyper Text
                        Mail Language (Html), have just added several new media of transmission for printed messages
                        and they have also added to the amount of reading that a typical person can cope with
                        (Romiszowski, 1988:128).<br /><br />

                        The role of printed materials is being enhanced by information revolution and the days
                        of printed media are far from being over. However, this does not suggest that printed
                        materials are used effectively and efficiently during instruction. In-fact, quite often
                        instructors abuse printed materials during instruction. The abuse of printed materials
                        results from the ease with which printed materials can be obtained, reproduced and circulated
                        which often leads to their excessive and inappropriate use in the instructional process.<br /><br />

                        It is strongly recommend that you use printed materials correctly during instruction.
                        Teachers need to follow the correct procedure for utilizing instructional materials.<br /><br />

                        The following types of printed materials; <kk>
                            text books, handouts, assignment sheets, individualized
                            study materials, word processed documents, and work sheets
                        </kk>. Let us consider each of these types in more detail.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme ml-5">
                        <kk>Text books</kk> - These are versatile and provide random access to the message
                        that it contains and users are able to control the process by which they gain the
                        information that they seek. Text books are relatively cheap compared to other types
                        of media. They are also durable, and easily accessible. They are portable, and fairly
                        economical to buy and maintain. As we mentioned in Unit 2, text books can be used either
                        as basic text or as chief sources of information for a particular class level and subject,
                        as a core-basic text with two or more other titles complementing each other, or as
                        supplementary and enriching source of information for a particular subject and class level.<br /><br />

                        <kk>Handouts</kk> - comprise of the different types of information-providing materials that are
                        given out to students usually in connection with a taught lesson or programme. They include; sets
                        of notes (complete or in skeleton form), tables, diagrams, maps, or any other illustrations or
                        support materials. Handouts can be used for a wide range of purposes such as; complete sets of
                        notes for specific areas of the curriculum or topic, designed to be given to students to save
                        them from having to take notes during the lesson. For example, handouts could comprise of skeleton
                        notes with blank spaces given to students to complete during the lesson or a shorter document
                        usually one sheet that is given to students to save them from having to copy complicated diagrams,
                        maps, sets of data or assist when illustrating specific concept or idea.<br /><br />

                        <kk>Assignment sheets</kk> - comprise of materials given to students describing tasks to be carried out.
                        They include; problem description sheets, reading lists, laboratory recording sheets, briefing sheets for
                        projects and seminars, etc.<br /><br />

                        <kk>Individualized study materials</kk> - comprise of the different textual materials that are used in
                        connection with individualized learning such as study guides, modules, structured notes, textual support
                        materials for mediated learning systems, etc.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Printed materials can play three basic roles in individualized instruction:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                They can constitute the actual vehicle by which the instruction takes place.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They can be used to structure and/or control or manage the instructional process
                                with the main instruction being carried out via other media e.g. text books.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They can be used to support other individualized learning media by
                                providing the required support such as worksheets (Ellington, 1985).
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <kk>Resource materials for group exercises</kk> - comprise of the various printed materials that are
                        used in connection with group learning exercises. For example; background reading
                        material, instruction sheets, data sheets, etc.<br /><br />

                        <kk>Worksheets</kk> - implies a device by which the teacher helps the students
                        to work as far as possible to his/her full capacity. A worksheet is not merely
                        an instruction sheet with one or more precise instructions, but it also includes
                        questions that even though demanding they encourage students to think for themselves
                        about the results of their work and thereafter draw conclusions.

                                <i> User friendly</i>. Properly designed printed materials are easy to use and do
                                not require special efforts to navigate through. Students can stop at any
                                point in the material todiscuss or even refer to other sources such as
                                dictionaries, reference texts, etc.

                                proceed at their own pace. Lesson materials can be designed in a
                                variety of ways to allow for self-paced instruction (Anderson, 1983).

                                <i> Reading level</i> - Most printed materials are written at a
                                certain reading level. It is important as a teacher to
                                remember that some of the students in our classes are non - readers,
                                poor readers, or lack adequate literacy skills and therefore some
                                reading materials might be above their reading level.

                                can easily be abused. For example, when teachers require students to
                                memorize many facts and definitions from a particular textbook, or
                                when teachers use particular textbooks as the only source of information,
                                and carry them to class in order to read from them and make notes from them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>  One-way presentation</i>- Some printed materials are not interactive and
                                they tend to be used in a passive way without comprehension.

                                <i> Curriculum rigidity</i> - Some textbooks dictate the curriculum
                                rather than being used to support the it. Text books are often
                                written to accommodate the curriculum guidelines of a particular country.

                                <i> Vocabulary</i> - Some texts introduce a large number of vocabulary
                                terms and concepts in a short amount of space. This places a
                                heavy cognitive burden on students which might be overwhelming
                                for some students (Heinich, et al.: 107-108).

                                <i>  Presentation of information</i> - By presenting the information logically
                                and in a pre-digested form, printed materials deny the reader the
                                ability to think, organize the information, and arrive at independent
                                conclusions. Hence, printed materials especially text books do not
                                stimulate interest on the part of the user to pursue any of the
                                information presented much further.

                                <i> Ignore instructional innovations</i> - Printed materials rigidly prescribe
                                and pre-arrange all learning outcomes which deny students the ability
                                to apply knowledge into novel situations.  Most printed materials especially
                                text books do not aim towards inquiry, problem-solving, or critical thinking.
                                A single text books used in a particular class level is not likely to meet the
                                varied learner abilities in a typical class.

                                <i> Out-dated information </i>- The process of publishing printed materials particularly
                                text books is long and involving, such that by the time a text book is published,
                                most of the information is obsolete. This makes it difficult to keep the information
                                contained in printed material current and up to date.

                        The most common application of printed materials is the presentation of content information
                        (Heinich et al. 1996:108).  Students are given reading assignments and held accountable for
                        the material during class discussion and on tests. Teacher-made handouts can also complement
                        a teacher's presentation or be used by students as they study independently.<br /><br />

                        Students may also use printed materials to augment either the information
                        presented by the teacher or other forms of media. Students frequently also
                        refer to supplementary printed materials such as books and journals from
                        the library or media centre to locate information on specific topics not
                        covered in their textbook.<br /><br />

                        Application of printed materials should be linked to types of learning
                        and the various learning domains, namely;<kk> cognitive, affective and psychomotor.</kk><br /><br />

                        Under cognitive learning, printed materials could sometimes (amongst many other things) be used to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                provide factual information such as basic facts, procedures and principles
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                teach recognition and discrimination of relevant stimuli
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                present vocabulary
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Provide directions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Under psychomotor learning, printed materials can be used to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                teach steps in psychomotor skills
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                demonstrate positions of things during motion
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                teach the various psychomotor skills such as drawing, measurement, etc.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Under affective learning, printed materials can be used to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                provoke emotional responses in the learner through drama, visuals etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                teach on positive and negative attitudes (Anderson, 1983:115).
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        When selecting the printed materials, consider the desired type of
                        learning so that you select materials that will bring out the type
                        of learning outcomes that you wish to achieve.
