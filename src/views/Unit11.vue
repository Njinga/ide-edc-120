                      This unit introduces you to the
                      concept of Educational
                      Technology as well as
                      to the other key concepts
                      that are applicable to the
                      field of Educational Technology.
                      Some of the questions that you
                      need to ask yourself include the following:
                      <i>
                          What is Educational Technology? What other
                          concepts relate to educational Technology?
                          Is Educational Technology relevant to teaching and learning?
                      </i>
                      The unit also introduces you to Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
                      which is closely related to educational/instructional technologies as they too
                      (ICTs) are used as equipment and tools when teaching learners in a classroom.
