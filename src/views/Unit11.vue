                                        This unit introduces you to the
                                        concept of Educational
                                        Technology as well as
                                        to the other key concepts
                                        that are applicable to the
                                        field of Educational Technology.
                                        Some of the questions that you
                                        need to ask yourself include the following:
                                        <i>
                                            What is Educational Technology? What other
                                            concepts relate to educational Technology?
                                            Is Educational Technology relevant to teaching and learning?
                                        </i>
                                        The unit also introduces you to Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
                                        which is closely related to educational/instructional technologies as they too
                                        (ICTs) are used as equipment and tools when teaching learners in a classroom.
