                                Since media selection should be systematic, to select the most
                                appropriate media for any lesson you need to follow a certain
                                process, namely: Choosing a media format;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Obtaining specific media and materials;

                    <p class="textjustify meme">
                        <kk>A media format</kk> refers to the physical form in which
                        a given message is incorporated and displayed. Media formats
                        include for example, flip charts, audio, video, or computer
                        multimedia. Each media format has different strengths and
                        limitations in terms of types of messages that can be
                        recorded and displayed.  To choose the media format,
                        consider the criteria that we have discussed above.
                        This will guide you in deciding on the best media format to use.

                        objectives are available, they should be used to save time and money.
                        The simplest, most cost-effective way to incorporate instructional materials
                        into a lesson is to use existing materials.

                        Whenever you decide to use readily available media materials, the following
                        questions will guide your selection decision:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Does the medium match the curriculum?

                            <li>
                                Is the media accurate and current?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Does the medium contain clear and concise language?

                            <li>
                                Will the media arouse motivation and maintain interest?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Does the media provide for learner participation?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Is the media of good technical quality?

                        Besides the above criteria, other selection criteria will vary with
                        different media formats. For example, video raises the issue of the
                        pace of presentation.

                        If you cannot locate entirely suitable materials and media off the shelf,
                        you might be able to modify what is available. For example, you might
                        have a video clip that shows a needed visual sequence but the audio
                        portion of the video is inappropriate because it is too advanced for
                        the students. In such a case, you might show the video with the sound
                        turned off and then provide a narration yourself. Similarly,
                        you could use a simulation game format but then change the
                        rules of play either to increase or decrease the level of sophistication.
