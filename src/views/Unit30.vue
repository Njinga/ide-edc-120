                        So far we have discussed the range of media available to us as
                        teachers that we could use during instruction.  However, it is
                        not every media that we choose to use that would help the students
                        to learn. We need to remember that our main aim during the lesson is
                        to help students learn. You must be aware by now, that in order for
                        learning to take place, instruction may be necessary. <i>
                            Instruction refers to the
                            arrangement of information and environment to facilitate learning
                        </i>.
                        By environment, this does not just mean where instruction takes place but
                        also the methods, media and equipment that are used or are needed to guide
                        the learner's study.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        However, information and environment will change
                        depending on the instructional goal. Therefore, as
                        the expected learning outcomes also change, so must
                        the teacher change the way he/she arranges the instructional
                        environment.  For instruction to take place, instructional
                        media are used since they form part of the instructional
                        environment.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        The instructional/learning process involves the selection,
                        arrangement, and delivery of information in an appropriate
                        environment and the way the learner interacts with that
                        information. Usually the arrangement of information and the
                        environment is normally the responsibility of the instructor
                        and the designers of media.  As a teacher, you need to select,
                        arrange, and deliver the information in an appropriate environment
                        so that learners can interact with it and convert it into knowledge.<br />
                        As a teacher, you will have to decide which instructional medium or
                        media to use. To make an informed choice of medium/media from the
                        range of media that we have discussed, you need to know the advantages
                        and limitations of each medium and you need to have a selection criterion
                        that will inform your choice of media.<br />
                        This unit is therefore meant to assist you
                        in making informed decisions on your choice
                        of media during instruction.  To assist you in that regard, we will discuss
                        the criteria for media selection as well as the media selection process.
                        We will also look at some models that are used in making decisions about
                        media choices.
