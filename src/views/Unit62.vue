                        Most users of technology are not and do not expect to become electronic wizards or 
                        specialists but they want to be able to use the hard-ware safely and effectively. 
                        The most fundamental elements of effective technology use are simply getting the 
                        equipment properly set up, keeping it running, and being ready to cope with snags,
                        which always seem to occur at the most inopportune times (Heinich et al., 1996:364). 
                        A major concern to consider whenever we use technology is safety. Accidents involving 
                        equipment can be serious and even fatal. You or your students could sustain injuries if
                        you mishandle equipment. As an educator, you are responsible and legally liable if students
                        are exposed to hazardous conditions. As a teacher, you serve as role model for safe practices
                        when using technology and you need to know and practice good safety habits.

                        We also know that electronic equipment is expensive to buy and we need to take good 
                        care of it through proper maintenance and handling in order to increase its life span. 
                        Care of equipment and proper maintenance ensures continued use of the equipment for a long time.
