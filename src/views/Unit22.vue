                        So far we have defined the terms 'educational technology' and 'communication.'
                        We have noted the importance of effective communication in a classroom
                        in order to facilitate learning. As well as that, educational technology
                        focuses on the use of resources to facilitate learning. We need to use
                        instructional media to physically extend our ability to communicate.
                        We have also looked at ICTs and their relationship to educational
                        media and/or instructional technology. We have also noted from our
                        discussion on communication and learning that one of the key
                        elements of communication is the channel or medium of communication.
                        The channel/medium carries the message to be shared. We  went on to
                        say that the medium is indeed the message, since it affects how the
                        message is received and interpreted by the target audience.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Some of the main channels that we use in human communication are our senses.
                        We therefore need to use media because they appeal to the different sensory
                        channels and can make teaching and learning effective. We should therefore
                        enrich the instructional environment with many and varied experiences including
                        the use of instructional media.

                        Perhaps before we discuss the role of
                        instructional media in teaching and
                        learning, we need to understand the term 'media'.

                <h3 class="h3-responsive">2.2.1 What is instructional media?</h3>
                <div class="note note-secondary">
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Heinich et al. (1996:8) defines a medium as a means of
                        communication as it refers to anything that carries
                        information between a source and a receiver. For example;
                        diagrams, printed materials, computers, PowerPoint slides,
                        and instructors. (Please note that the plural for medium is 'media').
                        We can therefore conclude that, instructional media refers to the
                        resources both human and non-human that a teacher deliberately
                        selects and uses to carry information during instruction to
                        facilitate learning.  These are the resources that serve an
                        instructional function for education and training.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The terms used to describe the instructional
                        resources that teachers use in the classroom
                        have changed over the years to reflect technological
                        advances in the field of communication. For example,
                        in the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, most of media
                        available was in form of visuals and it was described
                        as <i>'visual education</i>, but with the advent of the
                        radio tape recorders, TV, and a combination of radio and visuals,
                        the term <i>'audio-visual</i> was accepted. Then in the 1950s,
                        the term <i>multimedia</i> was coined to describe the early
                        combination of various still and motion media for increased educational effect.
                        This reflected a methodology called 'multi-media'
                        approach, which was based on the principle that a variety
                        of audiovisual media and experiences could be combined to
                        reinforce the value of each other.  Later in the 1980s,
                        the computer technology was introduced into the classrooms
                        and the technology changed into <i>computer multi-media'. Multimedia</i> refers
                        to any combination of two or more media formats that are integrated to
                        form an informational or instructional programme (Heinich, et al.; 1996).
                        The term was adopted in connection with computers to refer to combinations
                        of sounds and images stored in different devices and combined through computer
                        software into an interactive programme.

                        Today, we can combine a variety of media materials together using
                        the computer technology to form<i> computer-based instructional media.</i>
                        Since the early days of simpler media combinations, designers have
                        understood that individual learners respond differently to various
                        information sources and instructional methods, and so chances of
                        reaching an individual are increased when a variety of media is
                        used as a result of <i>multi-sensory involvement</i>.

                        As you continue reading this module, you will
                        come across the term <kk><i>'Hypermedia'</i></kk>. Hypermedia refers to
                        a computer software that uses elements of text, graphics, video, and audio
                        and is connected in such a way that the user can easily move within the information.
                        Hypermedia is based on cognitive theories of how people structure knowledge and
                        how they learn. It is designed to resemble the way people organize information
                        with concepts and relationships. The relationships or associations between ideas
                        are called <kk>'links'.</kk>

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        When defining the term 'media', we need to differentiate between
                        <i>materials and equipment. Material</i> is the term used to refer to
                        those instructional resources that might be used to convey
                        information without complete dependence on verbal symbols or
                        language. For example, concrete objects, construction materials,
                        pictures and graphics fall in this category. <i>Equipment</i> is what we use
                        to display the media materials. These include projectors, video
                        and audio players and computers to mention just a few.

                <div class="note note-secondary">
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Media serve a variety of roles in education. Their primary role is to help students
                        learn and one way they do this is by providing an information-rich
                        environment (Newby; Stepich; Lehman; & Russell, 2006:120).  For example,
                        media can provide simulated experiences and students do not have to go to
                        far off places to observe or experience certain reality. A good example is
                        a flight simulator whereby student pilots learn how to fly an airplane while
                        still on the ground. Computers also offer simulation capabilities where a motor
                        mechanic student for example, can observe on a computer, how the engine runs
                        (pistons running and fuel being burnt). For more on simulation refer to sub-sections 2.3.8.1
                        (Role of Computers in Instruction) and 5.4.1 (The Computer as a Teacher - Simulation).
                        In this regard therefore, we can conclude that the use of visuals can add meaning to words,
                        thus enhancing learning.

                        As  principle, educational experiences that involve the learner physically and that give concrete examples are retained longer than abstract experiences such as listening to a lecture. Instructional media help to add elements of reality for instance, when you include a picture or a highly involved computer simulation in lecture.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Psychologist Jerome Bruner proposed that instruction should proceed from <kk>direct experience (enactive) to iconic representation</kk> of experience such as the use of pictures and films and finally to <kk>symbolic representation</kk> such as use of words (Bruner, 1966:49).   An icon is an image that resembles a real object.  In other words, students learn best when they observe the reality directly, but when the reality cannot be observed directly, the next best option is to use some representation of the reality through the use of icons such as pictures. The last alternative to use should be a symbolic representation of the reality through the use of words or any other symbols. The reason is that words do not resemble the objects that they represent and therefore cannot be understood unless the individual has some experience with reality about that particular word. Words on their own generally do not carry meanings as meanings are in people depending on their experience with those particular words.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        In the cone of experience, we start with the learner as participant in the actual experience, then move to the learner as an observer of the actual event, then we proceed to the learner as an observer of a mediated event (an event presented through some medium), and finally to the learner observing symbols that represent an event.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The two diagrams above show how Edgar Dale's "Cone of Experience" organized learning experiences according to the degree of concreteness each possesses. At the bottom is hands-on experience but as you ascend the cone, concrete experience begins to drop out with the stimuli becoming more abstract. At this stage, the stimuli require more skill on the part of the learners to interpret the images they carry.  That is why a lecture, even when illustrated, is considered as an abstract presentation.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Note that the cone of experience is broad-based at the bottom where direct and purposeful experiences are provided and gets very narrow at the top where verbal symbols are provided. Also note the interdependent nature of learning experiences and instructional materials.   Learning experiences at the bottom of the cone tend to hold students' attention longer and involve active student participation. Media used at the top of the cone are said to be more passive but suitable for transmitting large amounts of information quickly.

                        Media serve as extensions of our efforts to communicate with our students. A large percentage of things that we learn are a direct result of our visual and audio-visual experiences. Our senses are the gateway to the acquisition of knowledge. According to Sampath (1981), research shows that we learn:
                        <ul>
                            <li>83% through the sense of sight;</li>
                            <li>11% through the sense of hearing;</li>
                            <li>3.5% through the sense of smell;</li>
                            <li>1.5% through the sense of touch;</li>
                            <li>1% through the sense of taste.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Research also shows that we remember:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                10% of what we hear;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                50% of what we hear and see;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                90% of what we hear, see and do.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
    
                        Hence the Chinese saying, <kk><i>"If I hear, I forget, If I see I remember, If I do, I Know".</i></kk>

                        The above information clearly shows that visual senses are very important in the learning process and that retention of information is closely related to active learner involvement in the learning experience. Media can be used to support one or more of the following instructional activities:

                                <kk>Gain attention</kk> - There is an attention-getting factor associated with instructional media that keeps the audience alert. For example, a picture on the screen, a question on the board, or music playing as students enter the classroom. All these serve to get the students' attention and arouse their interest.
