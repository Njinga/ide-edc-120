                                        The fact that teachers bring instructional media into the
                                        classroom does not suggest that students learn from the media.
                                        For the media to be useful in the instructional process, it must
                                        be integrated into the lesson. The media must be properly selected,
                                        incorporated into the lesson, and students involved in the utilization
                                        process.  According to Duhaney (2000:71), technology use in the
                                        classroom should only be considered appropriate if it is used for
                                        specific purposes in the teaching and learning process, and
                                        that its incorporation in this process should not just be as
                                        an appendage, but an integral part of the teaching and learning objectives.

                                                Integration of technology in the classroom has been the focal point for innovation
                                                in the educational system of many developing countries (Abu-Jaber, 1987; Abu-Ras,
                                                1979; El-Hmaisat, 1985; Al-Sharhan, 1993; Mohammed, 1994). One aspect of integration
                                                of technology that has been studied is the training required for effective use of
                                                instructional technology.  The type and amount of training in instructional technology
                                                available to teachers varies enormously in quantity and quality (Abu-Jaber, 1996:60).

                                                found that although a majority of teachers indicated that they had some training in
                                                technology, only 20% felt very well prepared to integrate educational technology in

                                                in two areas; they must be able to operate technological hardware,

                                                new technology in the classroom, they are often unsuccessful because they
                                                lack the necessary implementation skills, including necessary training.

                                                For education to be successful, public schools must make current technologies
                                                which are already available in the business world, also available to students
                                                (Davis & Henry, 1993). Also, for this transition to smoothly occur, students must
                                                become actively involved, and teachers must be given the resources and training
                                                needed to properly implement technology (Moursund, 1991; Pearlman, 1999; Stintson, 1993).

                                        links (Hains et al; 2000).  Often instructors use media and delivery systems
                                        with little thought as to how they fit into the instructional system experienced
                                        by their students (Belland, 2000).

                                        Utilization of media involves the adoption of innovations (Belland, 2000).
                                        As new technological products and processes become available to educational
                                        professionals, they need to be in a position to evaluate them and provide

                                        teaching tools have shown promise, if teachers have limited knowledge regarding these
                                        tools and their abilities, they may have difficulty evaluating the effectiveness of
                                        these aides in student learning.

                                        We are also aware of the fact that teachers are living in a time of general
                                        uncertainty where rapid changes in professional practice are commonplace
                                        (Wheeler, 2001:7). One of the most widepread changes in professional practice
                                        is emerging as a result of the implementation of Information and Communications
                                        technology (Wheeler, 2001:7).   In the context of teaching and learning, Jones & Knezek (1993),
                                        argue that ICT should be seen as a means of improving efficiency in the educational process.
                                        It has been shown that the use of computers in education can generally help to improve memory
                                        retention, increase motivation and generally deepen understanding (Dede, 1998).  According to
                                        Perraton (2000:31), Communication technologies have been used for three purposes, to
                                        <i>widen access to education, to raise its quality, and to reform it.</i>

                                        Heide & Henderson (2001) contends that technology can be used to enhance instruction
                                        and expand the limits of the existing curriculum as it can be used to
                                        obtain, organize, manipulate and communicate knowledge and information.
                                        Therefore, technology can be used to address the range of different
                                        learning styles and different modalities of individual learning strengths.
                                        We want students to learn how to acquire information where and when they
                                        want it and develop both their cognitive and communicative skills.
                                        According to Kershaw (1996), for delivery systems to be effective,
                                        they must act as a means of facilitating teaching and learning rather
                                        than an end in itself. This is illustrated by trends shifting from
                                        teacher-focused delivery systems to learner focused.

                                        a teacher must change (Wheeler, 2001:12).  Firstly, because

                                        Becker (1999:32), concluded, "along with word processing, the Internet may be the
                                        most valuable of the many computer technologies available to teachers and students".
                                        However, all these claims remain to be validated (Brien & Eastmond, 1994; McKnight et at.; 1993).
                                        The current research  will attempt to validate this claim by exploring the extent to
                                        which computers are used during instruction and in particular the Internet.

                                        Effective integration of instructional technology in the curriculum is a complex process
                                        that will require restructuring of schools and classrooms.  Educators
                                        are far from agreeing on what is the most cost-effective way of integrating
                                        technology into the classrooms (Prawd, 1996:283).  Dyrenfurth & Miller, (1984), contend that if changes
                                        in media utilization patterns and use of more sophisticated classroom technology are to become a reality for
                                        technology educators, the following must occur:
