                                        The role of the teacher has changed since the 20<sup>th</sup> Century as the purpose of
                                        education has expanded rapidly. Goals of education have expanded and exceeded the focus
                                        of the 3Rs (Reading, writing and arithmetic).  In the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, some aspects
                                        of education and teaching will remain the same, while others are changing dramatically.
                                        At the moment, teachers must be equipped with a number of skills such as the use of the
                                        Internet, as instruction can take place via the Internet through what is known as E-learning.

                                        As well, there are many developments in using technology for instructional purposes. In some
                                        schools in Swaziland they have introduced the use of Tablets and printed materials are used
                                        minimally. Mobile devices such as cell-phones are also used extensively in education.
                                        Platforms such as Skype allow teachers and students to communicate through video conferencing,
                                        texting (sms or chatting), audio as well as video.

                                        Let us briefly look at some of the areas where change might or has occurred:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>

                                                Tremendous changes are/have occurred in the way information is stored and accessed with computers
                                                and digital technologies. Today, the Internet is connecting students to a wide range of resources
                                                for learning, which were previously not available.  Arends (2007:7) argues that the Internet will
                                                become (if it has not already) the primary medium of/for information and will substantially redefine
                                                other forms of print and visual publications. This in turn will cause educators to redefine how they
                                                conduct their lessons and the assignments they give in class.  As educators worldwide expand the use of
                                                technology in teaching and learning, it is becoming evident that technology will end up doing more than
                                                just enhancing instruction. It might prove to be a serious force in changing the nature and form of instruction.

                                        </ul>

                                        Consider the case of the cell phone, which has completely changed the nature of personal, and business communication.
                                        Like the cellular technology, educational technologies are essentially communication tools and any advances in
                                        educational technologies will fundamentally alter the way in which we communicate educationally.
                                        Another example is in distance education courses like the one you are currently enrolled in. A major
                                        characteristic of distance education programmes is the physical separation between the instructor and
                                        the learners for most of the time. So, such programmes are offered through various combinations of digital
                                        and other distance delivery technologies.

                                                Education in the past was organized in such a manner that the teacher's role was
                                                to transmit information or 'the truth' to students. Teachers were regarded as
                                                experts whose duty was to pass information to the students who were passive listeners.
                                                It is now believed that knowledge is personal and meaning is constructed by the learner
                                                through experience. Therefore, learning is a social and cultural activity in which learners
                                                construct their own meaning by interacting with the information and by being actively involved
                                                in the process of creating meaning. This is what has come to be described as <i>
                                                    'constructivist learning'.
                                                    Constructivism
                                                </i> is a perspective in teaching and learning in which a learner constructs
                                                meaning from experience and interaction with others where the role of the teacher is to provide
                                                meaningful experiences for students (Arends 2007: Glossary: 3).

                                    <p class=" text-justify meme">
                                        According to Heinich et al. (1996:18), the ultimate measure of learning is based on
                                        the ability of the student to use knowledge to facilitate thinking in real life.
                                        From the constructivist perspective, learning is viewed as a process where students
                                        are actively engaged in relevant experiences with opportunities for dialogue so that
                                        meaning can evolve and be constructed.    Learning takes place not in passive classrooms
                                        but in communities characterized by high levels of learner participation and engagement.
                                        This will imply that teachers will have to change the way they plan and organize instruction.
                                        Teachers will no longer be the source of information but will act as facilitators by providing
                                        opportunities and resources for students to interact with and construct their own meanings.
                                        This will imply that teachers will have to make support technologies such as E-mail, Internet,
                                        Web sites and Electronic Conferences available for students to use.

                                        In your answer you might need to consider the new technologies that have invaded
