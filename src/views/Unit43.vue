                        Now that we know the process for designing your
                        own instructional media, let us now discus how you
                        can design, plan and produce different types of
                        instructional materials. Please note that we cannot
                        discuss how to design, plan and produce all the different
                        types of media that we discussed in Unit 2. Instead, we
                        will pick on a few types instructional media materials that
                        you are likely to produce in your own local context. Let us
                        start with the visuals.

                    <h3 id="item-1-1" class="h3-responsive">4.3.1 Process of visual design </h3>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Designing a visual display begins with gathering or producing the individual pictorial
                        and text elements that will be used in the display.   At this stage, it is assumed that
                        you have already determined the students' needs and interests regarding the topic to be
                        taught and have decided on the objectives to be achieved through the visuals that you
                        are planning to present whether via a bulletin board, overhead transparencies, PowerPoint
                        presentation, printed handouts, or other computer screen displays.<br />
                        In your visual design, you need to consider how you will achieve the visual design goal,
                        which encompasses; <i>
                            ensuring legibility, helping the viewer to quickly see your message,
                            and focusing attention on key points (Heinich et al; 1996:74).
                        </i>

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        The key design suggestions to consider include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>Visual elements</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Verbal elements</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Elements that add appeal.</i>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        <kk><i>Visual elements</i></kk><br />
                        The type of visuals selected for a particular situation depends
                        on the learning task. For example, based on Dale's Cone of Experience
                        that we discussed in Unit 2, visual symbols can be divided into three
                        categories, namely; realistic, analogic, and organizational (Houghton & Willows, 1987).

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        <i>Realistic</i> visuals show the actual object under study. The degree
                        of realism can be heightened by use of realistic colours, which is one of
                        the major purposes that colour serves. The realistic visual is the closest
                        it thing to the original.<br /><br />

                        <i>Analogic</i> visuals convey a concept or topic by showing something else
                        and implying a similarity. Teaching about electricity flow by showing water
                        flowing in series and parallel pipes is an example of using analogic visuals.
                        Such visuals help the learner to interpret new information in light of prior
                        knowledge and in that way facilitating learning.<br /><br />

                        <i>Organizational</i> visuals include flowcharts, graphs, maps, classification charts,
                        etc. They are mainly used to show relationships among concepts or points in textual material.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        <kk><i>Verbal Elements</i></kk><br />
                        These refer to lettering style and location. Most displays incorporate some type of
                        verbal information in addition to visuals. When evaluating a display for its
                        instructional potential, or in preparing your own display, you need to consider
                        the lettering as it can add to effective communication effectively too.
                        At a minimum, ensure that lettering is legible in terms of size and spacing
                        and that the style is consistent with the intended message.<br /><br />

                        <i>Letter Style</i><br />
                        The lettering style should be consistent and in harmony with the other elements
                        of the visual. For informational and instructional purposes, a plain (not decorative)
                        lettering style is recommended. It is recommended that a display -or series of related
                        visuals, such as a slide series-use no more than two different types of styles, which
                        should be in harmony with each other.<br /><br />

                        For best legibility, use lowercase letters, adding capitals or uppercase only where
                        normally required. The colour of the lettering should contrast with the background
                        colour for purposes of legibility since legibility depends on contrast.<br /><br />

                        <i>Size of letters</i><br />
                        Displays such as bulletin boards are meant to be viewed by people situated at a
                        distance of about ten (10) meters. In such cases, the size of letters is crucia
                        l for legibility. A common rule of thumb is to make lowercase letters 1.2
                        centimeters for each four (4) meters of viewer distance.<br /><br />

                        <i>Spacing between letters</i><br />
                        The distance between the letters of the individual words must be
                        judged by experience rather than on mechanical basis since
                        some letters are irregular compared to others.<br /><br />

                        <i>Spacing between lines</i><br />
                        Vertical spacing between lines is also important for legibility.
                        If the lines are too close together, they blur the distance and if
                        they are too far apart, they will seem disjointed. For equal spacing,
                        start by drawing lines of equal distance using a ruler. This will help
                        you get used to even line spacing.<br /><br />

                        <i>Elements that Add Appeal</i><br />
                        Your visuals will have a slim chance of having an effect unless
                        they capture and hold the viewer's attention. How can you achieve this?

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>Surprise</i>. Consider what grabs attention. You will need
                                to provide novel stimuli every time in order to sustain
                                the attention of the viewers.

                                <i> Texture </i>- most visuals are two-dimensional but
                                you could add a third dimension with the use of
                                texture or actual materials. For example, you
                                could use cereal grains to design a map of
                                Swaziland that will appear like it has a
                                third dimension.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Interaction </i>. Viewers can be asked to respond to visual
                                displays by manipulating materials on the display to answer
                                questions raised by the display. For example, you can prepare
                                a visual display to show different parts or components, and
                                then prepare some cards with names for students to align the
                                correct part or component with the appropriate name.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        <kk><i>Pattern</i></kk><br />
                        Once you have made decisions on the elements to include
                        in your visual display, you should then decide on how the
                        viewer's eyes will flow across the display. This is what
                        can be described as 'pattern'. Pattern is influenced by;
                        alignment, shape, balance, style, colour scheme and colour appeal.<br /><br />

                        <i>Alignment</i> refers to positioning of elements to give a clear visual relationship
                        to each other in order to aid understanding and interpretation. Viewers will perceive
                        elements to be aligned when the edges of those elements are aligned on the same imaginary
                        horizontal and vertical line.  These imaginary lines should be parallel to the edges of the display.<br /><br />

                        <i>Shape</i>-Visuals should be arranged to present a shape that is familiar to the viewers.
                        Use a pattern that attracts and focuses attention as effortless as possible. For example
                        circles, rectangles, or tri-angles provide a convenient framework, as the shape is predictable to the viewers.<br /><br />

                        <i>Colour scheme</i>- as you choose colour, consider the harmony of the colours. Any two
                        colours that lie directly opposite each other on the colour wheel are called complementary
                        colours such as red and green, or yellow and violet.   <kk>Complementary colours</kk> harmonize well
                        in terms of overall colour scheme. Colours that lie next to each other on the colour wheel
                        are called <kk>analogous colours</kk>. For instance, blue-green, blue, and blue-violet are analogous
                        colours. Colour appeal is also important. Artists appreciate that blue, green, and violet are
                        cool colours while red and orange are considered warm colours. When choosing colour for
                        instructional materials, consider the emotional response that you are seeking.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        <kk><i>Arrangement</i></kk><br />
                        You should arrange items within the pattern as viewers assume
                        that elements close together are related and those that are far
                        apart are unrelated. If a display includes verbal labels for the
                        picture elements, connect the related words and pictures clearly.<br /><br />

                        <kk><i>Consistency</i></kk><br />
                        If you are planning a series of displays such as a set of overhead
                        transparencies or PowerPoint slides, you should be consistent in
                        the arrangement of elements.

                    <h3 id="item-1-2" class="h3-responsive">4.3.2 Visual planning tools</h3>

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        When you plan and design your visuals you could use visual planning tools
                        such as <kk><i>story boarding and lettering stencils and guides.</i></kk>  Storyboarding is
                        a technique borrowed from film and video production that allows you to creatively
                        arrange and rearrange your sketches.  In storyboarding, a sketch or a simple representation
                        of the visuals you plan to use is put on a card or a piece of paper along with the narration.
                        After a series of cards have been developed, they are placed in a rough sequence on a flat surface
                        or on a storyboard holder. You can use small pieces of paper to create your storyboard.
                        The individual storyboard cards or papers can then be divided into areas to accommodate
                        the visuals, narration and production notes. The format of a storyboard should fit your
                        need and purpose.<br /><br />

                        A wide variety of lettering techniques for visuals exist. The simplest is freehand
                        lettering with markers and felt-tip pens which come in an array of colours. Letters
                        can also be cut from construction paper or other materials. Pre- cut letters are
                        available in stationery and office supply stores.  These letters are easy to use as
                        they come with an adhesive backing. You could also purchase lettering guides from stationery

                        <kk>Graphic materials</kk><br />
                        Graphics is an art form where ideas are expressed in diagrams, pictures, graphs,
                        charts, collages and posters. Much of graphic material is made for display on
                        bulletin boards, flannel boards and chalkboards. If you think about it hard enough,
                        you will realize that graphics are part of our everyday life. After all wedo
                        see graphics on the billboards, on TV commercials, on clothes, etc. Graphics
                        attempt to express or convey a thought, impression or point of view.   Much of
                        the graphic media is not only useful as motivational materials but also, you and
                        your students can easily create them.<br /><br />

                        Posters in particular are very effective in promoting school activities, campaigns and
                        special events. You could follow the design procedure that we have discussed earlier on
                        to design your own posters. Remember that posters rely on use of symbols to express certain ideas,
                        lettering and colour.  One form of poster that you could involve your students in creating <kk><i>is collage</i></kk>.
                        A collage is an art form that uses layers and textures of materials to portray a symbolic picture.
                        Materials for making collage could be obtained from pictures, cloth, newspapers, magazines etc.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        The process for designing text is similar to that of designing visuals. Once
                        you have created your message, you will need to assemble the elements. Remember
                        that text is designed using word processing from your computer.<br /><br />

                        Just like in visuals, choose the background and underlying pattern. Do not
                        skimp on the page margins, as pages that are too full, too dense, cluttered
                        or too disorganized are discouraging to readers.  Remember that paragraphs
                        are aligned at the left margin, not at the right margin or at both margins;
                        the left margin alignment provides best readability.<br /><br />

                        Next, arrange the elements. Use space by moving elements closer together
                        or further apart before using styles like bold, italic, or underlined text.
                        Use text styles to reinforce the underlying pattern of the document. For
                        example, make subheadings bold and nothing else bold.  Note that on a
                        vertical dimension, you need to decide on the spacing between lines of
                        text, between the title and other text, and between text and subheadings.<br /><br />

                        Note that titles may be aligned with the left margin or centred on the page.
                        If you centre the title, take care that it looks centred and not simply misaligned.
                        The subheadings should be aligned with each other, if they are centred each one
                        appears to be aligned differently and the viewer may have trouble identifying them.
                        All regular text should be aligned at the same margin except for lists and block
                        quotations.<br /><br />

                        After word processing you need to check and revise the text.
                        Check whether the titles and subheadings take up more than one
                        line and make sure that the phrases on each line make sense. Move blocks
                        of text close to their subheadings and away from other text on the page.
                        Use of space helps the viewer make sense of the page easily and quickly.
                        Always spell-check your work and ensure that words that  will make sense
                        to a reader and facilitate understanding.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        The chalkboard is probably the most widely used media display in the classroom since
                        even the most disadvantaged schools at least has a chalkboard. It is also the easiest
                        media to use either for writing or for displaying other types of media. To make the
                        chalkboard an effective instructional media also requires planning, and effective
                        chalkboard techniques require practice. Use of the chalkboard is not likely to make
                        a poor teacher a good teacher, but its appropriate use can make both poor teachers
                        and good teachers better.<br /><br />

                        <kk>Planning for chalkboard Use</kk><br />
                        Before you use the chalkboard ask yourself these questions;

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme font-italic">
                        <ul>

                                What part of my lesson is important enough to be placed on the chalkboard?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What aspects of the lesson are likely to be unclear to some of the students?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What diagrams/drawings/figures or statistics can I use on the chalkboard to illustrate the content?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                How can I capitalize on the immediate feedback from the chalkboard?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                How can I involve the students in developing chalkboard work?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Therefore, think before you write or draw on the chalkboard
                        to consider what you want to show, and how best to present it.<br /><br />

                        <kk>Role of the chalkboard during instruction</kk><br />
                        The chalkboard can be used to prepare drawings or writing. You can draw your diagrams or
                        illustrations in advance before the class commences and then keep it covered and only
                        reveal it when you want to talk about that particular content or refer to the diagram
                        for illustration.  Colour should also be used as a way of motivating students and helping
                        to emphasize specific aspects of the lesson.

                                Always use a clean chalkboard since a key element to
                                good visibility is contrast. The clearer the board,
                                the better the visibility of what is written.

                                Make your chalkboard work readable. Whatever you write should
                                be read even from the back of the class. This is achieved by
                                producing bold, clear lines and letter characters. Spacing is
                                critical in achieving readable writing. Spacing refers to
                                regulation of distance between elements of a letter, letters
                                in a word, words in a line, and between successive lines
                                in a piece of writing.   Spacing determines the shape of
                                the letters. To ensure good, legible letters, the space
                                between the downward strokes of letters like <i><kk>u</kk></i>,
                                and the breadth of letters like <i><kk>o</kk></i> must have
                                uniform appearance.
                            </li>

                                The spacing of letter elements should be constant.
                                Letters and the spacing between the letters should
                                be uniform and when forming a word, letters should
                                be written close together to ensure legibility.

                                Legibility of words is affected by excessively
                                small spaces. Successive lines of writing must
                                also be properly spaced for good legibility.

                        The Whiteboard is a new generation form of the chalkboard. It is called whiteboard
                        as it is normally white. One of the reasons being that not only can one write on
                        it, but it can also be used as a screen for projection purposes. Special marker
                        pens are used to write on the whiteboard and can easily be erased. One should
                        never use a Permanent Marker on the white board as it cannot be easily erased.
                        Materials can also be pinned on the whiteboard for display to the learners. Below
                        we will now look at another type of whiteboard known as "Smart Board".<br /><br />

                        The Smart Board is an interactive whiteboard that uses touch detection for user input
                        (for example scrolling and right mouse-click) in the same way as normal PC input devices
                        such as mice or keyboards. A projector is used to display a computer's video output onto
                        the whiteboard, which then acts as a huge touchscreen.

                        ink works by using an active digitizer that controls the PC input

                            It is advisable to follow a practical procedure when designing
                            overhead transparencies. The procedure includes:
                        </kk>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Follow the design principles presented to
                                you under the sub-topic on designing visuals.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Assemble the elements. When you are choosing
                                elements, remember that viewers will stop reading
                                text once they know what it says, but will continue
                                looking at illustrations, especially when they are
                                talking about them. Therefore, use more graphical
                                elements than text in your transparencies and
                                supply verbal explanations yourself. Include text
                                for key ideas only. If you are using write-on
                                transparencies, make sure that you leave enough
                                margins for the frame.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Choose background and underlying pattern.
                                The title area should be at the top where viewers
                                begin to scan the display. Content area should be
                                limited to 1 or 2 images at most for graphical
                                displays and at most 6 bullet points for text display.
                                If you are using computer generated transparencies, you
                                could select a template for the underlying pattern.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Arrange the elements. Since the elements in a transparency
                                should be fairly large in order to project well, the challenge
                                is to fit the elements into the available space. In case you
                                have information that could be presented in a certain sequence,
                                you might consider designing <kk><i>overlays</i></kk> where the
                                bottom or the first transparency serves as the base and any
                                additional information builds on to it.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Check and revise. Practice your transparencies
                                and check on visibility of your elements.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        It is important to know how you can design Power Point
                        presentations nowadays since the world has become digitalized.
                        The following points will help you get organized.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        <kk>1. Plan your content first</kk><br />
                        Many people start the process of creating a presentation in PowerPoint
                        by entering text on the slides. This is not a good idea. The content
                        should drive the design. So the most important recommendation is to plan
                        your content first.<br /><br />

                        Always start your presentation on paper or word processor - draw your ideas
                        and link relationships between concepts. Ask yourself these important questions
                        before creating your presentation.<br />
                        <ol>
                            <li>What is the purpose of my presentation? </li>
                            <li>What do I want my audience to do because of the presentation? </li>
                            <li>What message do I want to deliver that will help me achieve that purpose?</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        <kk>2. Use a plain background and remove any unnecessary detail</kk>
                        When it comes to slide design, you should not think of decoration, but of
                        communication. Everything you add to your slides should add value to the
                        message you are communicating. Removing extraneous information from a screen
                        actually increases learning.<br /><br />

                        <kk>3. One idea per slide</kk>
                        Use each slide to express one idea. You can completely transform your presentation
                        from boring bullets to high impact visuals by putting one point on a slide. Something
                        as simple as having only one main idea per slide makes a big difference. Fewer words on
                        each slide will attract more attention and create a lasting impact.<br /><br />

                        <kk> 4. Support the headline with graphic evidence</kk>
                        Instead of bullets, support your points with graphic evidence. This can include
                        <i>photos, images, charts and diagrams</i>. Say the words and put
                        the visuals on your slides. Support your points with creative and
                        relevant images.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        <kk>5. You don't always need a slide</kk>
                        Not every point in your presentation needs a slide. You only need a
                        visual aid in a presentation if you would need one in conversation.
                        Slides should be projected only when they serve the presentation.
                        When you are not showing a slide, insert a plain black slide into
                        your slideshow.<br /><br />

                        For example you can use flip charts with or without PowerPoint;
                        flip charts can be used to sketch out an idea, get input from
                        the audience or provide a group activity to keep a presentation
                        lively. In this case, there is movement, there is interaction,
                        there is problem solving, and the activity is spontaneous and
                        created on the spot.<br /><br />

                        <kk>6. Put detail in the handouts</kk>
                        Create handouts that are distributed after the presentation.
                        Your handouts are the repository for detailed information.

                    <h3 id="item-1-9" class="h3-responsive">4.3.9 Designing audio media </h3>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Audio media materials can easily be designed and produced by both the teacher and
                        students since all that you need is an audio tape recorder and blank audiotape. Audio media
                        can be effective during instruction especially to achieve motivational, informational or
                        instructional purposes of teaching and learning.  Audio media is effective in teaching
                        many of the subjects offered in the school curriculum. For example, teaching of literature
                        either in English, French or African languages like siSwati. Audio media is also appropriate
                        in English Language, especially in drama. You can also use audio media to individualize instruction
                        particularly when you have slow learners in your class or when you are teaching complex topics that
                        students have difficulties understanding .<br />
                        To design and produce audio materials, the following procedure will be followed:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Formulate an instructional goal. Decide what you want to achieve by
                                using audio media. Is it  for motivation, information
                                sharing or for instruction?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Formulate the instructional objectives that will form the basis
                                of the audio programme to be produced.
                                What do you want to achieve?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Select the content to be presented and decide on the scope of
                                content coverage. It is recommended that an ideal audio programme
                                should only run for fifteen (15) minutes. Therefore, if you have a
                                lot of content to be covered prepare a series of audio programmes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Prepare a recording script. A script is an outline description of
                                the content to be presented and prepared in a format that will be
                                used for reading as opposed to talking. A script identifies even
                                the presenters or the people who will be involved in the presentation
                                of content and the actual content that they read. As you prepare a
                                recording script, consider how you will involve the learners in
                                meaningful learning activities.  Remember that audio media appeals
                                only to the sense of hearing; therefore to captivate the students'
                                attention requires that they get engaged in some activities as they
                                listen to the recorded materials.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To captivate the attention of the listeners, make sure that you
                                provide variety through appropriate sound effects, music, short
                                dialogue and voices of experts in your field.  All these might
                                be included in the script that you prepare since all presenters
                                need to know in advance whatever they will be required to say
                                during the recording.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Be creative in your script writing and be conversational.
                                Since audio media is meant for listening, converse with
                                the audience as you would normally converse with a friend.
                                Explore the content with the students rather than lecturing
                                to them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                As you present the materials, direct the students' attention
                                to whatever will be discussed before discussing it. Inform
                                the students what to pay attention to as they listen to the
                                audiotape.  For example, if they have to refer to a certain
                                diagram, instruct them what to look for or observe and give
                                them time during the presentation to do exactly that.
                                This means that you will need to pause occasionally for
                                students to carry out specific tasks or activities that
                                you will identify for them.  When you pause the tape, provide
                                a music interlude for students to know that the presentation
                                is still continuing.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When the presentation ends, it is useful to summarize
                                the key points or ideas covered during the lesson.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Finally prepare some follow -up activities for the
                                students to assist in learning transfer and to
                                reinforce what will have been presented
                            </li>

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        A podcast is an audio blog post created by recording your voice
                        or other sound, uploading the recording to the Internet, and
                        publishing it on your blog. The first step therefore is for
                        you to have created a blog. Visitors to your blog simply
                        select a link on your blog, turn on their computer speakers
                        and listen to your podcast (or audio blog post) rather than
                        reading your post.

                        from <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a>  Once on the website,
                        follow instructions to download the
                        software. Otherwise if the software is available on the e-learning website, you could then use it.<br /><br />

                        <i>Step 3: Prepare your podcast content.</i><br />
                        Take some time to think about what you are going to say during your podcast. You can
                        even write a script based on a particular topic. If it is an assignment, then your
                        recording should be based on the assignment.<br /><br />


                        <i>Step 4: Record your podcast.</i><br />
                        Turn on your microphone, start your audio software and begin recording.
                        Save the file when you are done.<br /><br />

                        <i>Step 5: Upload your podcast file to your online host.</i><br />
                        Upload your podcast file to your web host. If you plan to record a lot
                        of podcasts or your blog gets a lot of traffic, you might want to create
                        a new hosting account to hold your podcasts, so you do not reach your blog
                        hosting bandwidth limits too quickly. Instructions for uploading the podcast
                        may be given on the e-learning website.<br /><br />

                        <i>Step 6: Get the URL of your uploaded podcast file.</i><br />
                        Once you upload your podcast file to your hosting account, copy the
                        podcast URL and keep that URL handy as you will have to paste it in your blog.<br /><br />

                        <i>Step 7: Create a new blog post.</i><br />
                        Open your blogging application and create a new blog post. Give it a title and
                        add any text you would like to introduce your podcast.<br /><br />

                        <i>Step 8: Paste the URL for your podcast file into your new blog post.</i><br />

                        Using the URL you copied earlier for your uploaded podcast file, paste that information
                        into your new blog post as new media or a new enclosure link, depending on the blogging
                        application you use.<br /><br />

                        <i>Step 9: Publish your new blog post.</i><br />
                        Select the publish button in your blogging application to send
                        your new blog post with your podcast link included live online.<br /><br />



                        <i>Step 10: Test your podcast link.</i><br />
                        Open your new live blog post and select your podcast link to ensure it is working correctly.<br /><br />

                        The last tool or software we are going to discuss in this module is Skype.
                        Skype is used as a communication tool through short messages, audio, and video calls.
