                        In this unit, we are going to discuss maintenance, care, and
                        storage of instructional media/technology equipment and materials.
                        Since instructional media/technology equipment are either expensive
                        to buy or difficult to obtain, it is necessary that we take care of
                        them by maintaining them and storing them in the most appropriate and
                        safest places.  We also need to know how to trouble shoot when using the
                        equipment and materials since several problems may arise whenever we
                        use media equipment and materials. Note that it is not possible to discuss
                        the maintenance, care and storage of all the equipment and materials that
                        you are likely to use. In this case, we will select and discuss how to maintain,
                        care and store some of the equipment/technologies and materials.

                            Refers to a distortion of the image on the projection screen.
                            The effect takes its name from the typical shape of a key-stoned
                            image which is wide at the top and narrower at the bottom like a
                            keystone.
