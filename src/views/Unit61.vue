                                        In this unit, we are going to discuss maintenance, care, and
                                        storage of instructional media/technology equipment and materials.
                                        Since instructional media/technology equipment are either expensive
                                        to buy or difficult to obtain, it is necessary that we take care of
                                        them by maintaining them and storing them in the most appropriate and
                                        safest places.  We also need to know how to trouble shoot when using the
                                        equipment and materials since several problems may arise whenever we
                                        use media equipment and materials. Note that it is not possible to discuss
                                        the maintenance, care and storage of all the equipment and materials that
                                        you are likely to use. In this case, we will select and discuss how to maintain,
                                        care and store some of the equipment/technologies and materials.

                                            The effect takes its name from the typical shape of a key-stoned
