                            In this unit we have discussed how to care, maintain and store media equipment and
                            materials. We have given some examples to illustrate how to care and maintain equipment
                            the equipment. We have noted that one major concern whenever we use equipment and materials
                            is safety. We have mentioned that since electronic equipment is expensive; we should take
                            good care of it through proper maintenance and handling. I hope you will apply some of
                            the techniques that we have discussed to care and maintain your equipment in order to prolong
                            their life span and for them to serve you better.
