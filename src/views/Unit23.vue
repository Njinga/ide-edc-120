                    <p class="text-justify">
                        There are different ways of categorizing instructional media, and for the purposes of this module we will use the following categories to group the range of instructional media for teaching and learning which are borrowed from Heinich et al. (1996):
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">

                            <li>Non-projected media;</li>
                            <li>Projected media;</li>
                            <li>Audio media;</li>
                            <li>Motion media;</li>

                            <li>Web-based media </li>
                            <li>Social Media</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br />
                        Let us now discuss each one of these categories of media. We will start by looking at the non-projected media.

                <div class="note note-secondary">
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Non-projected media refers to the range of media resources that do not require any equipment (hardware) to project them onto a screen for viewing.  Non-projected media include: real objects, models, non-projected visuals (still pictures, charts, graphs, drawings, posters, cartoons and comics and book illustrations), visual display surfaces, and printed materials.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Many of the non-projected media that are mentioned and discussed are so common that instructors are inclined to underestimate their instructional value. Most of them are also readily available from textbooks and magazines, as well as from the immediate environment of the school. They are inexpensive, easy to use and some can be obtained at  no cost at all. They can also be produced or developed by teachers. <i>Please note that media do not have to be expensive or exotic to be useful for instruction. What matters is the effectiveness and appropriateness of the media in achieving the instructional goal.</i>    Let us discuss each one of these types of media in some detail.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        <kk> Real Objects</kk><br />
                        Everywhere in our environment, real things become sources of information or content for teaching and learning. Such objects can also serve as stimulators for learning when they are studied, handled, tasted, and manipulated (Erickson & Curl, 1972:86).  Real objects include; tools, coins, rocks, artifacts or material remains such as costumes, plants, animals, etc.  Real objects are some of the most accessible and interactive materials for educational use.  Real objects fit almost at the bottom of Dale's Cone of Experience and will be most effective especially for learners who are encountering a subject about which they have had little direct experience in their daily lives.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Real objects may be used as they are, or they can be modified to enhance instruction. Examples of modifications include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>Specimen</i> where actual plants and animals or parts are preserved for later use and close inspection.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Exhibits</i> where collections of artifacts of either historical or scientific nature are brought together with printed information to illustrate a point.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Cutaways</i> where devices such as machines have one side cut away to allow close observation of the inside details or inner workings (Heinich et al.; 1996:102).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Besides using real objects to present information, raise questions, and providing hands-on experiences, real objects also play a variable  role during the evaluation phase of instruction.  They can be displayed in a central place for learners to identify them, describe their function, or  compare and contrast them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        <kk>Models</kk><br />
                        Models refer to three-dimensional representations of a real thing. Things in the real world always have three dimensions. <kk>They have a length, a width and a depth</kk>. Whenever we teach, we need to create as much reality as possible by representing the things, as they would appear in real life.  However, this is not always possible.   For example, you might visit a hydro-electricity power station but still fail to understand how the generator works since you need to look inside the generator to understand how it works. In such a case, a model might be necessary. A model is a scaled representation of the object that it represents. The model might be a true copy of the actual object, might be larger, or even smaller. It might be complete in details or simplified for instructional purpose.  Models can provide learning experiences that real things cannot provide. For example, a model can be dismantled to provide the interior view of the object, which cannot be done with real objects.

                            <li>
                                Inside details must be observed and cannot be better shown using cross-sectional diagrams.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Too many details which are all relevant appear in a diagram making it difficult to interpret.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When a third dimension (depth) aids understanding of a concept such as volume in Mathematics.

                        Models can be manipulated by adding colour, enlarging , or reducing them.  There are four types of models that we can use namely:

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Printed materials comprise of all textual and other materials that can be run off in large numbers on a photocopier or printing machine to be used by students or trainees.    Printed materials include; textbooks, fiction and non-fiction books, pamphlets, manuals, handouts, word processed documents, assignment sheets, study guides, and resource materials for group exercises such as instruction sheets and data sheets.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            As you might well be aware, printed materials, especially textbooks, have long been the foundation of classroom instruction.   Print media continues to be the most single, most common category of teaching and learning support materials. Even as computer-based multimedia and hypermedia invade the classrooms, through electronic communication such as e-mail systems, database networks, World Wide Web, Hypertext mail, and Portable Document Formats, the role of print is far from being over. Instead, the role of print is being enhanced by the information revolution as the amount of reading and printing that a typical person will engage in increases.   The most common application of text is to present information to students who read the content contained in printed media either for class discussion or for study.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Printed materials can easily be abused in their usage especially because of the ease with which the materials can be obtained, reproduced and circulated. Therefore, like all other media materials, use of print should be planned. As a teacher, you should determine the learning objectives to be achieved  and then select the print materials that would facilitate your students to achieve those objectives.    Always direct students' reading of printed materials with objectives and questions and supplement the print with other media. Earlier on we identified different types of printed materials. Let us briefly define them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            <kk>Text books</kk>- these are printed materials, in hard copy or electronic, used either for mass instruction, for individual or for group instruction. They serve as a source of information for a particular course, subject or programme. A textbook might be the chief source, a co-basic source, or a supplementary source of information meant to enrich the other sources. E-materials (e-books) are now very common in schools in developed countries. Book readers and Tablets or even mobile phones are used to read e-materials.
                        </p>

                            <kk>Handouts</kk>- these comprise of the different types of information-providing materials that are given out to students as single loose pages or a number of pages, usually in connection with a taught lesson or programme. They include; sets of notes (complete or in skeleton form), tables, diagrams, maps, or any other illustrations or support materials. In the technological era, electronic handouts are sent by email, accessed at designated websites, and downloaded from school websites and saved on CD's or other portable storage devices such as memory sticks. They can also be stored in mobile devices and used at any time.
                        </p>

                            <kk>Assignment sheets</kk>- comprise of materials given to students describing the tasks to be carried out. They include; problem description sheets, reading lists, laboratory recording sheets, briefing sheets for projects and seminars, etc. Again, teachers can also use the current technologies to give assignment instructions to learners electronically.
                        </p>

                            <kk>Worksheet</kk>- A worksheet is a device by which the teacher helps the students to work as far as possible to his/her full capacity. Worksheet encourages students to think for themselves about the results of their work and to draw conclusions. The new technologies have made it possible for worksheets to be downloaded as templates which can be easily used, modified, saved and re-used.

                            Still pictures are photographic representations or images of people, places, activities, and objects. Among the most common still pictures that are used during instruction include; photographs and illustrations from books, calendars, and magazines. Still pictures are mainly two-dimensional but using a series of still pictures taken from different scenes and angles or positions could compensate this shortfall.

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Photographs are particularly very useful when you want students to observe certain phenomena and describe their observations as a way of training them in analytical and observation skills.    Still pictures are also useful when you want to illustrate a certain concept; that is, how something looks like. We need to train our students to understand that textbook pictures and illustrations are not decorations and should be read and interpreted as they are also meant to increase understanding of the concepts being presented. As the saying goes, One picture paints a thousand words!' So encourage the students to give attention to them.

                            Drawings are graphic materials that employ graphic arrangement of line and symbols to represent the outline inter - relationships or key features of a person, place, things or concept. Drawings show relationships or help to explain processes such as how something works or is constructed. Drawings help to simplify whatever you intend to teach and make the message easier to understand.

                            Drawings can be used in all phases of instruction from introduction to evaluation. Drawings are readily available in textbooks and other classroom materials. As teachers we should learn to use drawings especially freehand ones to provide a conceptual structure of whatever we teach in order to aid understanding.

                            A chart is a combination of pictorial, numerical or verbal material designed to present a clear visual summary of an important process or a set of relationships. Charts are visual representations of abstract relationships such as quantities, chronologies of events, and hierarchies. Most charts serve as visual summaries containing a mix of visual and verbal elements. They could summarize data, explain a process, or describe a set of relationships.

                            Outline charts list the key points and sub-points in material while tabular charts present information in columns and are commonly used to present production or sales figures.

                            Tree and stream charts are used to represent developments and relationships  for example, a family tree or when you want to explain the many end products that are obtained from coal.   As well, time-line charts are used when we want to summarize a sequence of events or to make chronological comparisons, for example, when we want to compare wheat production for different countries over a period of time.

                            Graphs are used to provide a visual representation of numerical data. They also illustrate relationships among units of data and trends in the data, such as when you want to show the relationship between time and amounts or yields. Graphs are more visually interesting to observe than when you have raw data.

All that you need is to input data into the computer and give a command for the computer to create the type of graph that you need. Most spreadsheet programmes like <i>Microsoft Excel</i> have graph and chart options and you can use it to create graphs from numerical data.

                            A poster incorporates visual combinations of bold design, colour and a brief written message meant to catch the attention of the viewer instantly in order to convey a message. Posters are meant to catch and hold the viewer,s attention long enough to communicate a message.  Usually posters carry persuasive messages or messages that influence the audience to act in certain way. For example, you might be carrying out a campaign in your school against child or drug abuse. Posters can be used to promote good health practices such as not using drugs. Posters are similar to charts but they are smaller, simpler in detail and bolder in content and style.

Single glance posters </kk>mainly appeal to emotions and can easily be read and understood without any spoken word.<kk> Stop and study</kk> posters require you to look closely at the poster to interpret it. An effective learning technique is to have your students design posters as part of a class project on a topic you have discussed in class or on a topical issue you are interested in promoting some positive attitudes.

                            A cartoon is an interpretive picture that makes use of line, symbols and exaggeration to represent ideas, people, events, or situations in pictorial form.  Cartoons are mainly used to influence public opinion.   Cartoons employ the principle of caricature (gross and ludicrous exaggeration or distortion of parts of a whole to emphasize the part i.e. the nose, or the chin). A comic is a form of cartoon in which the characters enact a story in a certain sequence to create a continuous pictorial story.   Both cartoons and comics are humorous and interesting, easy to read and excite the students. Appreciation and interpretation however depends on the experience and ability level of the students.  Therefore, be sure that the cartoons and comics are within the experiential and intellectual range of your students.

                        Projected media refers to media formats in which still images are enlarged and displayed on a screen for viewing. Projection of the image is achieved by passing a strong light through transparent film, magnifying the image through a series of lenses and then casting it onto a reflective surface.   Among the projected media include; overhead projection, multi-image presentations, and computer image projection.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        <kk>Overhead Projection</kk><br />
                        Overhead projection was once the most widely used audio-visual device in the classroom and in training. Computer projection (commonly PowerPoint) is widely used as well. Due to the fact that the image is large and you can manipulate or add to it while projecting, the overhead projector is versatile and can be used to communicate in every subject in the curriculum. A typical overhead projector is a simple device. Basically, it is a box with a large stage on top. For it to function, light from a powerful lamp inside the box is condensed by a special type of lens called  <kk><i>'Fresnel lens'</i></kk> and passes through a transparency placed on the stage. A transparency refers to the type of film used for overhead projection.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        A transparency is made of photographic film that is capable of being imprinted with an image or text by means of chemical or heat process. The individual sheets of transparent film are called <kk><i>"acetates"</i></kk> in reference to the chemical composition of the standard type of film used. Transparencies may be used either individually or might be made into a series of images consisting of a base visual with more transparencies added on top to form <kk><i>overlays</i></kk>. Overlays refer to sheets of transparent film, each containing additional information, that is laid over the base transparency. Overlays could be used to explain complex processes in a step-by-step manner by flipping the overlays one at a time and adding additional details to the base visual.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        During the projection, a lens-and-mirror system that is mounted on a bracket above the box turns the light beam at an angle of 90 degrees and then projects the image back over the shoulder of the presenter. This type of projection where light passes through the transparency is referred to as <kk><i>'trans-missive'</i></kk> type.   In the other type of projector, the light source is above the projector stage and shines down onto the transparency. The light is then reflected by a mirror-like surface beneath the transparency back up and through the lens system. This type is referred to as <kk><i>'reflective'</i></kk> type. The reflective type of projector does not produce brilliant light and does not perform as well as the trans-missive type. However, it is portable, lighter, and more compact than the trans-missive type.
