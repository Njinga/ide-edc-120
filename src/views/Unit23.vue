                            Let us now discuss each one of these categories of media. We will start
                            by looking at the non-projected media.

                            Non-projected media refers to the range of media resources that do not require
                            any equipment (hardware) to project them onto a screen for viewing.  Non-projected
                            media include: real objects, models, non-projected visuals (still pictures, charts,
                            graphs, drawings, posters, cartoons and comics and book illustrations),
                            visual display surfaces, and printed materials.

                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            Many of the non-projected media that are mentioned and discussed are so common that instructors are inclined to underestimate their instructional value. Most of them are also readily available from textbooks and magazines, as well as from the immediate environment of the school. They are inexpensive, easy to use and some can be obtained at  no cost at all. They can also be produced or developed by teachers. <i>Please note that media do not have to be expensive or exotic to be useful for instruction. What matters is the effectiveness and appropriateness of the media in achieving the instructional goal.</i>    Let us discuss each one of these types of media in some detail.

                            <kk> Real Objects</kk><br />
                            Everywhere in our environment, real things become sources of information or content for teaching and learning. Such objects can also serve as stimulators for learning when they are studied, handled, tasted, and manipulated (Erickson & Curl, 1972:86).  Real objects include; tools, coins, rocks, artifacts or material remains such as costumes, plants, animals, etc.  Real objects are some of the most accessible and interactive materials for educational use.  Real objects fit almost at the bottom of Dale's Cone of Experience and will be most effective especially for learners who are encountering a subject about which they have had little direct experience in their daily lives.

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            Real objects may be used as they are, or they can be modified to enhance instruction. Examples of modifications include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <i>Specimen</i> where actual plants and animals or parts are preserved for later use and close inspection.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i>Exhibits</i> where collections of artifacts of either historical or scientific nature are brought together with printed information to illustrate a point.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <i>Cutaways</i> where devices such as machines have one side cut away to allow close observation of the inside details or inner workings (Heinich et al.; 1996:102).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            Besides using real objects to present information, raise questions, and providing hands-on experiences, real objects also play a variable  role during the evaluation phase of instruction.  They can be displayed in a central place for learners to identify them, describe their function, or  compare and contrast them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            <kk>Models</kk><br />
                            Models refer to three-dimensional representations of a real thing. Things in the real world always have three dimensions. <kk>They have a length, a width and a depth</kk>. Whenever we teach, we need to create as much reality as possible by representing the things, as they would appear in real life.  However, this is not always possible.   For example, you might visit a hydro-electricity power station but still fail to understand how the generator works since you need to look inside the generator to understand how it works. In such a case, a model might be necessary. A model is a scaled representation of the object that it represents. The model might be a true copy of the actual object, might be larger, or even smaller. It might be complete in details or simplified for instructional purpose.  Models can provide learning experiences that real things cannot provide. For example, a model can be dismantled to provide the interior view of the object, which cannot be done with real objects.

                                    Too many details which are all relevant appear in a diagram making it difficult to interpret.

                                <li>

                            Models can be manipulated by adding colour, enlarging , or reducing them.  There are four types of models that we can use namely:

                            Printed materials comprise of all textual and other materials that can be run off in large numbers on a photocopier or printing machine to be used by students or trainees.    Printed materials include; textbooks, fiction and non-fiction books, pamphlets, manuals, handouts, word processed documents, assignment sheets, study guides, and resource materials for group exercises such as instruction sheets and data sheets.

                            As you might well be aware, printed materials, especially textbooks, have long been the foundation of classroom instruction.   Print media continues to be the most single, most common category of teaching and learning support materials. Even as computer-based multimedia and hypermedia invade the classrooms, through electronic communication such as e-mail systems, database networks, World Wide Web, Hypertext mail, and Portable Document Formats, the role of print is far from being over. Instead, the role of print is being enhanced by the information revolution as the amount of reading and printing that a typical person will engage in increases.   The most common application of text is to present information to students who read the content contained in printed media either for class discussion or for study.

                            Printed materials can easily be abused in their usage especially because of the ease with which the materials can be obtained, reproduced and circulated. Therefore, like all other media materials, use of print should be planned. As a teacher, you should determine the learning objectives to be achieved  and then select the print materials that would facilitate your students to achieve those objectives.    Always direct students' reading of printed materials with objectives and questions and supplement the print with other media. Earlier on we identified different types of printed materials. Let us briefly define them.

                            <kk>Text books</kk>- these are printed materials, in hard copy or electronic, used either for mass instruction, for individual or for group instruction. They serve as a source of information for a particular course, subject or programme. A textbook might be the chief source, a co-basic source, or a supplementary source of information meant to enrich the other sources. E-materials (e-books) are now very common in schools in developed countries. Book readers and Tablets or even mobile phones are used to read e-materials.

                            Still pictures are photographic representations or images of people, places, activities, and objects. Among the most common still pictures that are used during instruction include; photographs and illustrations from books, calendars, and magazines. Still pictures are mainly two-dimensional but using a series of still pictures taken from different scenes and angles or positions could compensate this shortfall.

                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            Photographs are particularly very useful when you want students to observe certain phenomena and describe their observations as a way of training them in analytical and observation skills.    Still pictures are also useful when you want to illustrate a certain concept; that is, how something looks like. We need to train our students to understand that textbook pictures and illustrations are not decorations and should be read and interpreted as they are also meant to increase understanding of the concepts being presented. As the saying goes, One picture paints a thousand words!' So encourage the students to give attention to them.

                            Drawings are graphic materials that employ graphic arrangement of line and symbols to represent the outline inter - relationships or key features of a person, place, things or concept. Drawings show relationships or help to explain processes such as how something works or is constructed. Drawings help to simplify whatever you intend to teach and make the message easier to understand.

                            A chart is a combination of pictorial, numerical or verbal material designed to present a clear visual summary of an important process or a set of relationships. Charts are visual representations of abstract relationships such as quantities, chronologies of events, and hierarchies. Most charts serve as visual summaries containing a mix of visual and verbal elements. They could summarize data, explain a process, or describe a set of relationships.

                            Charts are classified depending on their function and for classroom purposes; we could identify the following types of charts:
                            <ul>
                                <li>outline and tabular charts;</li>

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            Outline charts list the key points and sub-points in material while tabular charts present information in columns and are commonly used to present production or sales figures. On the other hand, flow, organization, and process charts are used to show functional relationships such as a manufacturing process or organization of a government department.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            Tree and stream charts are used to represent developments and relationships  for example, a family tree or when you want to explain the many end products that are obtained from coal.   As well, time-line charts are used when we want to summarize a sequence of events or to make chronological comparisons, for example, when we want to compare wheat production for different countries over a period of time.
                        </p>

                                    you represent only one major concept and if you have a lot of information to convey, develop or use a series of charts instead of using a single complex chart to form a flip chart;

                            Graphs are used to provide a visual representation of numerical data. They also illustrate relationships among units of data and trends in the data, such as when you want to show the relationship between time and amounts or yields. Graphs are more visually interesting to observe than when you have raw data.

                            A poster incorporates visual combinations of bold design, colour and a brief written message meant to catch the attention of the viewer instantly in order to convey a message. Posters are meant to catch and hold the viewer,s attention long enough to communicate a message.  Usually posters carry persuasive messages or messages that influence the audience to act in certain way. For example, you might be carrying out a campaign in your school against child or drug abuse. Posters can be used to promote good health practices such as not using drugs. Posters are similar to charts but they are smaller, simpler in detail and bolder in content and style.

                            A cartoon is an interpretive picture that makes use of line, symbols and exaggeration to represent ideas, people, events, or situations in pictorial form.  Cartoons are mainly used to influence public opinion.   Cartoons employ the principle of caricature (gross and ludicrous exaggeration or distortion of parts of a whole to emphasize the part i.e. the nose, or the chin). A comic is a form of cartoon in which the characters enact a story in a certain sequence to create a continuous pictorial story.   Both cartoons and comics are humorous and interesting, easy to read and excite the students. Appreciation and interpretation however depends on the experience and ability level of the students.  Therefore, be sure that the cartoons and comics are within the experiential and intellectual range of your students.

Dioramas represent three-dimensional scenes often in miniature form to represent natural settings. Dioramas could be used to illustrate different concepts.  For example, in geography they can be constructed to illustrate how certain landforms like craters, rift valleys, etc. are formed.

                        Projected media refers to media formats in which still images are enlarged and displayed on a screen for viewing. Projection of the image is achieved by passing a strong light through transparent film, magnifying the image through a series of lenses and then casting it onto a reflective surface.   Among the projected media include; overhead projection, multi-image presentations, and computer image projection.

                        <kk>Overhead Projection</kk><br />
                        Overhead projection was once the most widely used audio-visual device in the classroom and in training. Computer projection (commonly PowerPoint) is widely used as well. Due to the fact that the image is large and you can manipulate or add to it while projecting, the overhead projector is versatile and can be used to communicate in every subject in the curriculum. A typical overhead projector is a simple device. Basically, it is a box with a large stage on top. For it to function, light from a powerful lamp inside the box is condensed by a special type of lens called  <kk><i>'Fresnel lens'</i></kk> and passes through a transparency placed on the stage. A transparency refers to the type of film used for overhead projection.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        A transparency is made of photographic film that is capable of being imprinted with an image or text by means of chemical or heat process. The individual sheets of transparent film are called <kk><i>"acetates"</i></kk> in reference to the chemical composition of the standard type of film used. Transparencies may be used either individually or might be made into a series of images consisting of a base visual with more transparencies added on top to form <kk><i>overlays</i></kk>. Overlays refer to sheets of transparent film, each containing additional information, that is laid over the base transparency. Overlays could be used to explain complex processes in a step-by-step manner by flipping the overlays one at a time and adding additional details to the base visual.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        During the projection, a lens-and-mirror system that is mounted on a bracket above the box turns the light beam at an angle of 90 degrees and then projects the image back over the shoulder of the presenter. This type of projection where light passes through the transparency is referred to as <kk><i>'trans-missive'</i></kk> type.   In the other type of projector, the light source is above the projector stage and shines down onto the transparency. The light is then reflected by a mirror-like surface beneath the transparency back up and through the lens system. This type is referred to as <kk><i>'reflective'</i></kk> type. The reflective type of projector does not produce brilliant light and does not perform as well as the trans-missive type. However, it is portable, lighter, and more compact than the trans-missive type.

                        One of the advantages of the overhead projector is that the teacher and students can easily prepare their own transparencies. Some of the methods to use to prepare transparencies include; <kk>direct drawing method and computer printing</kk>. The direct drawing method involves drawing directly onto a transparency sheet (write-on transparency) using a transparency-marking pen (overhead projector pen). Overheads created by computers have transformed the task of creating overhead transparencies with the use of any word processing software to prepare simple verbal overheads which can then be printed on plain paper to make a master copy for photocopying.

                        The overhead projector has the following advantages:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>Brightness</i>- the lamp and the efficient optical system generates so much light on the screen that the overhead can be used with normal room lighting.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Eye contact</i>- the projector is operated from the front of the room with the presenter facing the audience allowing direct eye contact to be maintained.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Ease of use</i>- overhead projectors are easy to operate and portable.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Manipulability</i>- projected materials can be manipulated by the presenter. For example, the presenter can add details, notes, diagrams, highlight with colour, etc. during presentation.
                            </li>

                                The effectiveness of overhead projection presentation depends heavily on the presenter.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Not self-instructional- overhead projection does not lend itself to independent study. It is mainly designed for large group presentation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Production process required- to use the overhead system, the material has to be made into transparencies by means of some production process.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Keystone effect- distortion of images is common with the overhead projector than with other projection systems. This distortion of image is referred to as <kk><i>'keystone effect'</i></kk> (Heinich, et al, 1996:140-144).

                        Audio media is rarely used during instruction yet students spend most of the time in class listening to the teacher.   Therefore, as teachers we can develop students' listening skills by using the audio media. Audio media refers to the use of human voice and other sounds for instructional purposes (Gathu, 2000:43).  Audio recordings can be prepared for group or individual listening and they can be used in a variety of ways. For example, a speech could be documented, a role-play or drama could be recorded, animal sounds could be recorded, and a meeting could also be verbally recorded.

                        A CD uses a tiny laser beam to retrieve the information from the disk. The CD allows us to store a lot of information. The instructor or students can selectively retrieve information from a CD since the digital storage format provides for random access of the data stored which means that you can directly go to and play any segment on a CD.  To use the CD, you will need a CD player though most computers have a CD deck as part of the computer accessories.

                        <kk>Video media</kk><br />
                        The word <kk>'video'</kk> comes from Latin and it simply means, <i>"I see"</i>. The primary meaning of video is the playing of moving images on a television type screen. Video images are recorded electronically on magnetic tape along with sound for playback.  Any media format that uses a television screen or monitor to present a picture can be referred to as video (e.g. DVD).  Originally, the concept of video was synonymous with broadcast television, but the concept has expanded dramatically in recent years. New technologies connected to television sets have been added such as home computers, video games and specialized cable TV services.   There are different formats of video. Among them are: video files, videodiscs, and compact discs.

                        <kk> Videodisc</kk><br />
                        A newer type of video medium called <kk><i>'digital video disc'</i></kk> (DVD) has rapidly replaced the video and laser discs.  DVD is a compact disc format for displaying motion video, which offers truly digital, optical recording, storage, and playback of full-motion video. A DVD has the same physical size as an audio CD or CD-ROM but it can hold four times as much data as a CD or CD-ROM.

                        <kk>Digital Video Camera</kk><br />
                        The most common option for creating digital video recording is using a digital video camera. A digital video camera captures and stores the target image in a digital format that can be downloaded to a personal computer or laptop. Some newer cameras can create a DVD that can be played instantly on any playback device. The resultant video files can then be manipulated, edited, and enhanced using digital video editing software. A digital video camera allows you to record digital images on storage devices and later transfer to a computer or for playback on a television. The user can edit the video on the camera before processing (using the camera) for final play on other devices.

                        Currently video is used in many ways. Gone are the times of video cassettes! DVD's and video files are used often. While DVD's are common, video files are easily manipulated and stored. For an example, video files can be emailed easily, can be stored on data bases, and can be played online (e.g. YouTube videos),

                        Despite technological advances, education has changed very little in some parts of the world.  Teachers still teach the same way they were taught and are comfortable using the tried-and-true strategies from which they learned. However, application of new technological tools makes many enhancements to these strategies possible (Lever-Duffy et al.; 2005).  To overcome any possible resistance to using the computer, it is best to begin by becoming more familiar with computers.

                        The computer is being used widely for word processing and desktop publishing. As teachers, we need to encourage our students to embrace the new technologies.  Therefore, the more we promote usage of computers by students to write assignments, projects, and homework the more we promote its usage as a learning tool. We should even encourage the students to integrate media such as graphics, sound and motion into the content that they write.

For inquiry and research, students can use <i><kk>databases</kk>, which are collections of related information organized for quick access to specific information </i>(Heinich et al.; 1996:231). Whereas a telephone book for example is a printed database, we can have databases also stored on your computer.

                        Since the focus of this sub-section is to discuss computer-based multimedia and hypermedia, let us now define these two terms and then discuss the range of computer-based media.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        The term <kk><i>multimedia</i></kk> refers to any combination of two or more media formats that are integrated to form an informational or instructional programme. <kk><i>Computer multimedia</i></kk> systems incorporate the computer as a display device, management tool, and /or source of text, pictures, graphics, and sound (Heinich et al.; 1996:260).   Multimedia today is synonymous with a computer-based format that combines text, graphics, audio and even video into a single, coherent digital presentation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        More than presenting information in multiple formats, <kk><i> Computer multimedia</i></kk>integrate the
                        multiple media into a structured programme in which each element complements the other.
                        The term multimedia was coined in the 1950s to describe early combinations of various still
                        and motion media <kk><i>('multiple media' or 'a combination media')</i></kk> to increase educational effect. The term has now been adopted in connection with computers to refer to combinations of sound and images stored in different devices which are combined through computer software to form interactive programmes. Multimedia systems provide
                        learning experiences to individuals and groups where multi-sensory involvement is emphasized.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        The term <kk><i>hypermedia</i></kk> refers to <kk><i>'linked media'</i></kk>. Hypermedia
                        are computer software that use elements of text, graphics, video, and audio that are
                        connected in such a manner that the user can easily move within the information.
                        Each user uses a pathway that is unique to his/her style of thinking and processing
                        information. Hypermedia provides a learning environment that is interactive and
                        exploratory. Hypermedia is based on cognitive theories of how people structure
                        knowledge and how they learn. You have been introduced to the various theories of
                        learning in your EDC 100 course.  We also made reference to the learning theories
                        in Unit 1 of this particular module. Please refer to the relevant section in Unit 1
                        and also to your <kk>EDC 100 Teaching Principles and Practice</kk> course module to remind yourself on the cognitive learning theory.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Hypermedia is designed to resemble the way people organize information with concepts and their relationships. These relationships or <kk><i>links</i></kk> are associations between ideas. For example, when you think about a bicycle, you create a link between ideas about transportation and recreation. With hypermedia, one can compose and display information that might include text, audio, and visual information. Using the example of the bicycle, the learner can connect the word 'bicycle' with a photograph of a girl riding a bicycle in the field.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Computer hypermedia systems can be used for different instructional purposes. Among them are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>Browsing- </i>where users navigate through information by choosing routes that are of interest.

                            <li>
                                <i>Linking-</i>where users create their own special connections within the information.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Authoring- </i>The process of creating multimedia or hypermedia is called <kk><i>authoring</i></kk>. This is where users create their own unique collections of information by adding or linking text, graphics, and audio as they wish
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        The most common application of hypermedia authoring in a classroom is when students develop hypermedia projects that allow students either as individuals or as groups to create reports that summarize major efforts as in the case of a science experiment. Instead of merely compiling a written report, students could include written work with pictures, sound clips, video and links to describe what they did.

                        In Unit 1 you were introduced to social media as an Internet-based form of communication. It is also commonly associated with Web 2.0 technology that focuses on integration, collaboration, and interaction. While you may collaborate or interact through social media platforms (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), Web 2.0 also allows collaboration through teaching and learning. Some of these media may be termed "Participative Delivery Systems." In this case participants are the major authors as they create the content and supporting materials. Some of these technologies include Wikis and Blogs.

                        <i>Collaborative/Participative technologies</i> offer a range of new ways that support learning by enabling learners to share and exchange both ideas and their own digital products. The technologies provide opportunities for building tools not only for authoring interactive multimedia content, but also for enhancing readers' experience beyond multi-media presentation, for example, through sharing comments, in-book search, browsing, skimming, visualisation, summarisation, and non-linear reading. Below are some participative tools we can use.

With this tool, you can create, edit and share documents online. The three Google Docs tools support <i>multiple authors</i> editing the same document, presentation, or spread sheet at the same time, tracking revisions and showing, near real time, what each author is doing. Because the documents are stored online, they are available on any computer connected to the Internet. Import and export options allow one to upload Word docs, Excel, PowerPoint and PDFs and output back in the same format. One can also quickly publish what has been created online with a click of a button.

                        Skype is a powerful video and voice application. Wikipedia describes Skype as a software application that allows users to make telephone calls over the Internet. In addition to making telephone calls, users can use Skype to:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make video calls (can actually see each other no matter how far apart you can be, </li>
                            <li>Engage in video conferencing (e.g. listen to a lecture and be able to ask and answer questions)</li>
                            <li>Send instant messages, and </li>
                            <li>Transfer files from one computer to another</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Skype is best known for its ability to let people make free calls from one computer to another-anywhere in the world. While most calls are free (depending on the service options one selects) when they are made to other computers, calls can also be made to mobile devices or landlines for a fee.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Skype can be used as a means to connect users from around the world. This free and easy to use application can connect colleagues, students and researchers all within a web browser. So whether it is for office hours or to help students complete group work online, Skype is a great tool for any educator. The best thing about Skype is the ability to make free phone calls (with or without video).

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Some limitations of Skype however are that:
                        <ol>
                            <li>It does not support emergency calls (i.e., 911),  </li>
                            <li>Calls may be dropped from time to time (depending on your internet speed), and </li>
                            <li>Some organizations might block the use of Skype on their network. </li>
                            <li>The cost of Skype varies depending on use. However, basic computer-to-computer phone calls can be made for free.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        There are many reasons for using Skype in education. They  include:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <i>Virtual field trips: </i> trips that are not possible due to financial reasons or distance can still be taken using Skype to transport learners to another country or area.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Interviewing: </i>connecting with and speaking to an author or celebrity can bring classroom theory alive and make it real for learners.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Homework help or extra lessons: </i> teachers can offer help with homework, long-term projects or give extra lessons to learners who are lagging through Skype.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Guest appearances: </i>guest teachers or experts on a subject can teach learners through Skype or give an explanation directly from their work environment.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Illness: </i>learners who are hospitalized or who suffer from long-term illnesses and are schooled at home or hospital can also benefit by being included in lessons through the Skype platform.

                        <kk>Skype Requirements</kk><br />
                        For Skype to work, the software must be installed in your computer, laptop, notebook, tablet or mobile phone. The person you want to communicate with must also have Skype installed in their gadgets. In this course you will have a chance to experience Skype when all the necessary requirements are in-place. However, through instructions on the course website, you should be able to experiment with other learners who have Skype installed on their gadgets.

                        <kk>YouTube (www.youtube.com)</kk><br />
                        YouTube is a video sharing website that enables users to upload video clips to the Web. Videos uploaded to YouTube can be accessed and viewed by a select group of users or open for anyone to view. Users can also view, comment, rate, embed, and link to their videos as well as the millions of other videos posted to the site. Signing up for YouTube is free and easy. Further, even if you do not plan to upload your own videos, signing up for an account enables you to bookmark your favourites and to create playlists.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        YouTube has become one of the largest repositories for video on the Internet, making it a great resource for educators. Staff and students can often find dozens, if not hundreds, of videos about the topics of their choice. YouTube has partnered with several universities and launched YouTube EDU focusing on university related videos and lectures. YouTube is also a great tool for creating personalized content allowing faculty to record lectures, introductions, and commentary.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        The benefits of YouTube is that it is free, easy to use, supports high definition (HD) content and users can set their videos to public or private. The only major drawback of YouTube is that it limits users to uploading videos that are 1 GB or less than 10 minutes in length. One other minor drawback is that a video can be removed from YouTube at any time throughout the semester. YouTube is free and does not cost anything to use.

                        Social media platforms also allow users to have conversations, share information and create web content. There are many forms of social media, including blogs, micro-blogs, wikis, social networking sites, photo-sharing sites, instant messaging, video-sharing sites, podcasts, widgets, virtual worlds, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        There are many ways in which information is conveyed from one person to the other. In the teaching/leaning process communication through social media is vital and its roles are numerous. Firstly it serves the purpose of the ease of learning. It provides learners with a situation where knowledge is abundantly available. Visuals help in adding meaning to words. As it is widely known in teaching, leaners understand better when they see and touch something. So when you explain abstract ideas then bring in a projector to show them what you mean, it helps to add the element of reality as they are seeing the object in front of them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        Social media is used as extensions of our efforts to communicate with students. Research shows that a major percentage (83%) of what people learn is derived through the sense of sight. Social media are also used to support instructional activities like feedback to students' work, visualisation of a lesson, transferring of abstract concepts to concrete objects, and presentation of new content. Media also helps learners to overcome physical limitations, improves the quality of learning and assists to provoke learners to change attitude of mind.

                        A wiki is a type of free online writing space that allows users to add, modify and update its pages.  If something is missing or incorrect in a wiki and permissions allow you to edit the wiki, you can easily add your thoughts or make changes to the wiki. It is essentially a fully editable web site.

                        Wikis can be used effectively by instructors for posting course information or lecture notes and inviting participation from learners. Notes can be distributed in the form of simple text, PowerPoint slides, or audio and video components. Learners can participate by adding their own notes and comments along with relevant links that they may have found. One can also create a discussion environment for a particular topic.

Wikis can also be used as e-portfolios of learners' work for evaluation by the instructor. Brainstorming activities can be especially powerful using a wiki, and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) pages are also possible.

                        learn. Students now are able to carry a whole library of reference material in their
                        pockets with them anywhere. Applications help organise student's life and become
                        useful study tools anywhere anytime.<br /><br />

                        According to Wikipedia, M-Learning or mobile learning has different meanings for different communities.
                        Mobile learning could be <i>
                            any sort of learning that happens when the learner is not at a fixed,
                            predetermined location,
                        </i>or it can be <i>
                            learning that happens when the learner takes advantage of
                            learning opportunities offered by mobile technologies
                        </i>.
                        What this means is that mobile learning decreases
                        limitation of learning location with the mobility
                        of general portable devices.

                        Mobile learning or M-learning can also be viewed as any form of
                        learning that happens when mediated through a mobile device, and a
                        form of learning that has established the legitimacy of 'nomadic' learners
                        (Alexander, 2004). Duncan (2010) states that: "In the 21st century,
                        students must be fully engaged. This requires the use of technology
                        tools and resources, involvement with interesting and relevant projects,
                        and learning environments-including online environments-that are supportive
                        and safe.... In the 21st century, educators must be given and be prepared
                        to use technology tools; they must be collaborators in learning-constantly
                        seeking knowledge and acquiring new skills along with their students."<br />
                        Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education March 3, 2010

                        While there are new developments on a daily basis on the use of technology
                        and in-particular mobile learning, any of the following can be applied using
                        mobile technology.

                        <ol>
                            <li>They can deliver the education or training.</li>
                            <li>They foster communication and/or collaboration between learners and facilitators</li>
                            <li>They can be used to assess or perform evaluations.</li>
                            <li>They allow individuals to access to performance support and/or knowledge support.</li>
                            <li>They may be used to capture evidence of learning activity.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        With M-Learning, students can access resources online, they can chat and
                        participate in discussion forums, and based on the capability of the gadget,
                        can also send and receive assignments and download them to their standalone
                        computer. This technology has also made it possible for individuals or learners
                        to access programmes that make it easier to participate as a learner or just
                        networking with other people, family and friends. This phenomenon is discussed next.
