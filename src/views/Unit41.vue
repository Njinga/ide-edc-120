                        Teachers have long been known for their creative use of available tools
                        and resources to produce instructional materials. Creating your own
                        instructional materials is sometimes unavoidable in a classroom, given
                        that teachers are faced with different and unique instructional situations.
                        Since our students differ in their characteristics and learning needs,
                        available instructional materials might not always work for our own
                        situations. This calls for creativity on our part as teachers to design
                        and produce our  own instructional materials.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        So far we have discussed the various types of instructional media
                        that we could use in our teaching, but think for a moment about
                        your own classroom where you have been teaching for so many
                        years and many of these media that are available. Answer honestly,
                        <i>
                            'How much of media materials have you used over the past few years?
                            Why have you not used other media?
                        </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        If you think hard about the reason why you have not used some of the media,
                        the main reason is that some media are not readily available. So, if
                        you were a little creative, you could design and produce your own
                        instructional media to meet your instructional needs. As a teacher
                        undergoing further training, you need to see yourself as a professional
                        teacher focused on building skills for the future. I am sure you would
                        like to make a difference in the way you will teach after furthering your
                        training, and not  continue teaching the way you have always done in the past.<br />
                        In this unit, you are not expected to become a skilled instructional technologist or a
                        media specialist by making your own teaching materials. This would be unrealistic given
                        the limited training you will have acquired at the end of this course and the limited
                        facilities available in the schools where you teach. Admittedly the instructional
                        materials are very scarce in our classrooms yet we all want to improve the way we
                        help our students learn by enriching the learning environment with appropriate
                        instructional media and materials.  Therefore, we have to be creative as teachers
                        in order to make our instructional environment more interesting and motivating.

                        In this unit we will therefore introduce you to the concepts
                        of designing, planning and producing instructional materials
                        to meet your instructional goals. We will discuss the process
                        for designing instructional materials so that you can be in
                        a position to create your own instructional materials should
                        the need arise.

                        To help translate the theory that is presented in this
                        unit into practice, you will be required to attend some
                        demonstrations on how to produce different instructional
                        media materials to meet your students learning needs.
                        These demonstrations will be scheduled to take place in room
                        C1: 1 within the Faculty of Education and you will be informed
                        when to attend them.  You will also be required to design your
                        own instructional materials and make a presentation to a small
                        group and this task will be graded as part of your practical work.
                        You will receive further information and instructions on this task
                        from the course lecturer.
