                        ICTs can be described as a combination of hardware, software and
                        the means of production that enable the exchange, processing and
                        management of information and knowledge. They offer new ways of
                        communicating and exchanging information and knowledge. Through
                        communication via ICTs, the world has since become  a global village
                        where for instance, people from one country can learn about happenings
                        in many other countries or even across continents as soon as the news
                        break. People can communicate with each other globally instantly and
                        access information or relevant data when needed at the mere touch of
                        a button. ICTs and traditional mass media such as television,
                        newspapers and radio, are therefore some of the components of
                        the information-transfer system in international communication.
                        Do you see the resemblance to educational technologies?

                <h3 class="h3-responsive">1.3.1 Types of ICTs</h3>
                <div class="note note-secondary">
                    <p>
                        ICTs include other communication
                        devices that facilitate
                        communication between
                        individuals, groups
                        as well as mass
                        communication.
                        These may
                        include
                        among others
                        posters,
                        charts,
                        overhead
                        projectors,
                        fax machines,
                        telephones,
                        newspapers
                        and bulletin
                        boards to mention some.
                        Television, newspapers and
                        radio are considered components of information transfer because of
                        the role they play in disseminating information to people in a 'mass' format.
                        The degree of their usage however varies based on the location and/or situation
                        one is in. In most African countries for example, the above communication devices,
                        including radio and television are the most common means of sharing ideas and disseminating
                        information. The above are also widely used in schools.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        While the term 'ICTs' can be interpreted as including a wide range of media, 'new ICTs' is used
                        to denote the use of computers and communication systems between computers.
                        These new ICTs are becoming more accessible, and users can obtain information
                        from various sources, and one computer could meet the needs of a large community
                        or school. This enables users to access programmes on the World Wide Web at a
                        convenient time, and send feedback through e-mail or chat.

                        Chat can be either through text, audio, or video or a combination of all. When
                        people chat, they go through discussion or 'chat' in real time. Teachers can
                        create chats using social media such as Whats App and Facebook for students
                        to chat, or if available, Learning Management Systems can also be used to
                        organise chats.

                <div class="note note-secondary">
                    <p class=" text-justify">
                        ICTs are a media of communication. We have seen how information is disseminated
                        through a number of media. One such method is <strong>broadcasting</strong>.
                        Traditionally, radio has been the main form of mass communication technology
                        that is able to reach many people at once. Radio broadcast can reach communities
                        at the very end of the development road - people who live in remote areas with
                        no phones or electricity. Radio reaches people who can't read or write, and even
                        in very poor communities, radio penetration is vast. Schools can organise radio
                        listening groups whereby school related programmes can form part of the curriculum
                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify">
                        Other communication devices include television, the Internet and mobile phones.
                        These technologies have made it easier for information to reach the general
                        public, teachers, students, and community members alike. Let us now look at
                        Information Technology (IT) and its relationship to ICTs.

                <div class="note note-secondary">
                    <p class=" text-justify">
                        Information technology is another element of ICTs.
                        For our purposes in this course, we look at equipment or
                        hardware. These are the hardware or equipment which
                        make the software designed to run specific programmes
                        work. They enable information (sound, text, graphics,
                        video, etc.) to pass through and reach the recipient
                        at the receiving end As well. These include computers,
                        television sets, telephones, radio, fax machines, and
                        many others. As you can see from the above description,
                        the same types of technologies keep coming back. Another
                        important related issue to ICTs is Telecommunication.
                        This is discussed briefly in the next topic.

                <h3 class="h3-responsive">1.3.4 Telecommunications</h3>

                <div class="note note-secondary">
                    <p class=" text-justify">
                        Telecommunications are an integral part of ICTs. Through telecommunications,
                        equipment, hardware, and gadgets are able to send, store, retrieve and
                        disseminate information to the end user. In this case therefore,
                        telecommunications may promote or hinder the functioning of IT
                        equipment and hardware. For example, telephones and mobile-phones
                        play a major role in connecting people and machines. If they are not
                        functioning properly, communication will be severely hampered. Are you
                        familiar with telephone companies that provide Internet services in
                        Swaziland? This service is enabled by a sound telecommunications infrastructure.
                        Schools can also be connected to the Internet via this system. ICTs through
                        telecommunications play a major role in providing communities with ways of
                        accessing information and knowledge through the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><i>School Libraries</i></strong></li>
                            School libraries are resource centres where pupils
                            can access information such as books, pamphlets,
                            magazines, etc.  Furthermore, a well-equipped school
                            library can offer other services such as photocopying,
                            computer facilities, Internet connection as well as
                            the use and production of audio-visual materials. As a teacher
                            therefore you should constantly use libraries as well as encourage your
                            learners to do the same.

                            <li><strong><i>Digital Libraries</i></strong></li>
                            Due to advancement in technology, digital libraries
                            are now very common in many parts of the world.
                            While there may not be one in your area, you can
                            access it through the Internet.  Digital libraries
                            operate like any ordinary library except that the
                            materials available are electronic or take a digital
                            format. Perhaps you have heard of e-books (electronic books).
                            These are books (just like an ordinary book) except that they
                            are not hard copies like the ones printed on paper and they cannot
                            be touched. They are digital or electronic.
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Digital and/or electronic materials are easily accessed and  easy to go
                        through (navigate) unlike  ordinary books.  For example,
                        you can search for key words and the system can instantly take
                        you to those word/s. Moving from section to section and  chapter
                        to chapter, etc. is easy and fast as well,.  One is also able to
                        print materials easily. This is possible through what is known as
                        <i>Hypermedia</i> or <i>Hypertext</i>. These terms will be discussed much further in
                        Unit 2 of this module.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">

                        Other resources which can be found in the digital library include magazines,
                        journals, music files, video/DVD files and many more. All these can be
                        accessed (downloaded) where there is free access, or where there is restriction
                        and you have to pay for time or subscribe (sometimes free subscription are
                        available but sometimes one has to pay). Teachers can be able to download Open
                        Education Resources (OER's) from different locations on the net. While ICTs have
                        many good things to offer, they also have limitations. Let us now look at some of
                        the limitations below.

                <div class="note note-secondary">
                    <p class=" text-justify">
                        In developing countries there are various social problems which
                        create barriers to people (schools included) owning and using
                        telecommunications and ICTs. These problems, amongst others, include
                        finances, illiteracy, cultural barriers, lack of telecommunications
                        infrastructure, lack of computer skills and technological know-how.
                        Others include lack of access to computers and computer networks as
                        a result of the digital divide. This amounts to no Internet access and
                        lack of significant usage opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify">
                        With the lack of computer skills for many teachers, a number of interventions
                        need to be put in place such as re-training/in-service training, etc.
                        For starters, this problem can be remedied once telecommunication
                        infrastructures have been established in their areas of residence.
                        In addition,  teachers need to have access to computers and the internet
                        and be capacitated to have the necessary computer skills.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" text-justify">
                        Other constraints to ICTs in rural areas for example, include the relying
                        on physical infrastructures which may not work properly. These include
                        electricity and poor telecommunications. Even when such infrastructures
                        are in place, difficulties arise when they are poorly maintained or too costly
                        to use. Teachers therefore are urged to use what is available cautiously, or
                        improvise where possible so that learners can benefit from the cast technologies
                        which are in place. In the next section, we will look at social media which is linked to ICTs
