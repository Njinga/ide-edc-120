                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The concept 'Educational Technology' is very wide and as a result difficult to define.
                        The term itself has been evolving over a very long time.   For example, when a classroom
                        teacher browses the Internet for new teaching materials, that teacher is using some of
                        the latest educational technology.  What you must realize is that educational technology
                        is not new at all, and it is by no means limited to the use of equipment let alone
                        electronic equipment. Modern tools and techniques are simply the latest developments
                        in a field that some people believe is as old as education itself (Roblyer, 2004).
                        The definition of the term educational technology varies depending on whether the
                        term is used by educators or by technologists.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Technology is both a tool and a process. As a process, technology refers to construction
                        uses and organization of knowledge for the achievement of practical purposes in intellectual
                        and social contexts while technology as a tool refers to material construction and operation
                        of physical systems based on knowledge of design.  Technology is commonly thought of in terms
                        of instruments, machines, and devices.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The term 'education' on the other hand refers to facilitation of learning by
                        arranging environments and information and it can result from either instruction
                        or experience.    Many educators use the term educational technology very broadly.
                        Educational technology for those educators includes any media that can be used
                        during instruction.  In such cases, educational technology is  simply  defined
                        as an array of instructional or communication tools that might prove helpful in
                        advancing student learning (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Please note that by media (also referred to as instructional media) we mean all
                        the materials and physical means that an instructor might use to implement
                        instruction and facilitate students' achievement of instructional objectives.
                        This could include traditional materials such as chalkboards, handouts, charts,
                        overhead projectors, real objects, as well as the newer materials and methods
                        such as DVDs, CD-ROMs, the Internet and interactive media.  Below is an example
                        of a media technology   that a teacher can use to project different instructional
                        materials.

                        Educational Technology relies on a broad definition of the word 'technology'.
                        The word technology can refer to material objects of use to humanity such as
                        machines, hardware or utensils, but it can also include broader themes such
                        as systems, methods of organization, and techniques.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The term educational technology therefore has several definitions that might
                        include any of the following components:
                        <ul>
                            <li>all components of informational technology that are used to deliver educational materials;</li>
                            <li>
                                complex and integrated processes involving people, procedures, ideas, devices and organization for analyzing problems,
                                implementing, evaluating and managing solutions in all aspects of human learning; and
                            </li>
                            <li>use of technology to improve teaching and learning. </li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The Association for Educational Communication and Technology (AECT), defines educational technology as
                        'The theory and practice of design, development, utilization, management,
                        and evaluation of processes and resources for learning'
                        (Lever-Duffy, J.; McDonald, J.B.; Mizell, A.P. (2005).

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The above definition takes the broadest view possible and allows us to explore the
                        full range of media that a teacher might use to enhance
                        his/her instruction and assist students to learn.
                        Based on the above broad definition, we can simply
                        define educational technology as <i>
                            any technology used by educators in support of the teaching
                            and learning process.

                        You will note that
                        educational technology
                        can include any resource
                        and any process that
                        facilitates learning.
                        For example, a teacher
                        might use educational
                        technology to enhance
                        the quality and clarity
                        of communication or might
                        employ a particular process or a
                        specific learning style or intelligence.

                        The term educational technology is often associated with instructional technology.
                        According to Heinich, Molenda, Rusell, & Smaldino (1996:411), Instructional
                        Technology refers to <i>
                            a complex integrated process involving people,
                            procedures, ideas, devices, and organization, for analyzing problems and
                            devising, implementing, evaluating, and managing solutions to those
                            problems in situations in which learning is purposive and controlled".

                <div class="note note-secondary">
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        If we go by the simple definition of educational technology as <i>
                            "any technology used by educators in support
                            of the teaching and learning process",
                        </i> as a teacher you have to be prepared for the use of technology
                        to keep up with the rapid changes in the world. Not only that but
                        also, the learners are different, learning occurs differently,
                        so teaching must vary too.  As a 21st Century teacher ,
                        you must be prepared to provide technology-supported learning
                        opportunities for your students. You should be able to use
                        educational technology effectively in your classroom to facilitate
                        learning.   You cannot do this unless  you know what technology
                        is available for teaching and learning, and how it fits into your
                        own instructional situation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        As you might be aware by now, for learning to take place, instruction may be necessary
                        <i>
                            Instruction in this case refers to the arrangement of information and environment
                            to facilitate learning.
                        </i>
                        By environment, we do not just mean where instruction takes place but also
                        the methods, media and equipment that are used or needed to facilitate and 
                        guide the learner's study. Information and environment will change depending 
                        on the instructional goal. Therefore, as the expected learning outcomes change,
                        you may need to change the way that you arrange the instructional environment.  
                        You need to adapt your instruction to changing times and environments, 
                        which necessitates that you have a thorough working knowledge of the 
                        many kinds of educational technologies available that might assist 
                        you in teaching and  enhance learning simultaneously. Educational 
                        technologies are the tools that a teacher might need to use in order
                        to create an effective instructional experience.
