                                        The concept 'Educational Technology' is very wide and as a result difficult to define.
                                        The term itself has been evolving over a very long time.   For example, when a classroom
                                        teacher browses the Internet for new teaching materials, that teacher is using some of
                                        the latest educational technology.  What you must realize is that educational technology
                                        is not new at all, and it is by no means limited to the use of equipment let alone
                                        electronic equipment. Modern tools and techniques are simply the latest developments
                                        in a field that some people believe is as old as education itself (Roblyer, 2004).
                                        The definition of the term educational technology varies depending on whether the
                                        term is used by educators or by technologists.

                                        Technology is both a tool and a process. As a process, technology refers to construction
                                        uses and organization of knowledge for the achievement of practical purposes in intellectual
                                        and social contexts while technology as a tool refers to material construction and operation
                                        of physical systems based on knowledge of design.  Technology is commonly thought of in terms
                                        of instruments, machines, and devices.

                                        The term 'education' on the other hand refers to facilitation of learning by
                                        arranging environments and information and it can result from either instruction
                                        or experience.    Many educators use the term educational technology very broadly.
                                        Educational technology for those educators includes any media that can be used
                                        during instruction.  In such cases, educational technology is  simply  defined
                                        as an array of instructional or communication tools that might prove helpful in
                                        advancing student learning (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia).

                                        instruction and facilitate students' achievement of instructional objectives.
                                        This could include traditional materials such as chalkboards, handouts, charts,
                                        overhead projectors, real objects, as well as the newer materials and methods

                                        Educational Technology relies on a broad definition of the word 'technology'.
                                        The word technology can refer to material objects of use to humanity such as
                                        machines, hardware or utensils, but it can also include broader themes such

                                        As you might be aware by now, for learning to take place, instruction may be necessary
                                        <i>
                                            Instruction in this case refers to the arrangement of information and environment
                                            to facilitate learning.
                                        </i>
                                        By environment, we do not just mean where instruction takes place but also
                                        the methods, media and equipment that are used or needed to facilitate and
                                        guide the learner's study. Information and environment will change depending
                                        on the instructional goal. Therefore, as the expected learning outcomes change,
                                        you may need to change the way that you arrange the instructional environment.
                                        You need to adapt your instruction to changing times and environments,
                                        which necessitates that you have a thorough working knowledge of the
                                        many kinds of educational technologies available that might assist
                                        you in teaching and  enhance learning simultaneously. Educational
                                        technologies are the tools that a teacher might need to use in order
                                        to create an effective instructional experience.
