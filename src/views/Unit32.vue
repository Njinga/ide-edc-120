                        The concept of a <i>'system'</i> refers to a dynamic and complex whole that
                        interacts as a structured functional unit.  A system can also be defined as
                        "a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified
                        whole". This can further be defined as "organized or established procedure".
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        As an example, a system could be a community situated within an environment.
                        Therefore, energy, material and information flow among different elements
                        that compose the system via semi-permeable membranes or boundaries.
                        Systems are often composed of entities or independent complete wholes
                        which can exist on their own but at the same time form part of the
                        complete whole. Hence the phrase, <i>
                            the whole is greater than the sum
                            total of all its parts put together.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        The systems approach is used to tackle a wide variety of
                        subjects in fields such as education, management, information
                        science, health, computing, engineering, and manufacturing.
                        In this respect, we apply the systems approach whenever we
                        are dealing with problems relating to education.<br />
                        The systems approach has four key components namely:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Analysis - analysis of needs (i.e. of students' needs,
                                of system resources like space, time, materials and students'
                                abilities). These analyses leads to a statement of the problem
                                in terms of the overall objectives.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Design - involves identification of the required solution
                                and strategies for addressing the problem including the
                                formulation of objectives.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Development - involves the planning of available
                                resources, preparation of materials and selection
                                of presentation media.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implementation/Evaluation-
                                involves trying out the solution either in a small or
                                large scale and evaluating the effectiveness
                                of the solution for improvement.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="note note-warning text-justify meme">
                        Please note that the systems approach is not necessarily
                        a step-by-step process. Analysis, synthesis, and evaluation
                        are recurring stages throughout the process and not necessarily
                        in the traditional format of beginning, middle, and end.

                        We are sure you have noted that in a teaching-learning situation
                        we have elements like learners, teachers, teaching-learning materials,
                        classrooms which we can describe as sub-systems. We also have the whole
                        school which is a system but made up of several sub-systems like classes,
                        teachers, students, materials, educational objectives, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        You might have looked at a lesson as a system and noted that when you
                        plan for teaching, you have an instructional goal to achieve and the
                        way you organize your instruction depends on the final outcomes that
                        you intend to achieve from your lesson which we refer to as <i>'objectives'</i>.
                        In that lesson, you have elements like yourself (a teacher), the students,
                        the teaching-learning materials, etc.  Before you present the lesson,
                        you begin by planning the lesson since the elements are arranged in
                        a hierarchy. Then you identify the teaching and learning activities
                        and how the interactions will take place.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        As you plan your instruction, you make use of
                        inputs from the environment such as text books
                        and other teaching-learning resources.
                        As you present the lesson, you receive
                        feedback from the students or from the
                        other wider school environment and you
                        use that feedback to adjust your teaching
                        since you need to respond to changes
                        happening around you.

                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        As you deliver the lesson, you notice that there are
                        alternative ways of attaining the lesson objectives
                        without following the methods that you followed on
                        this particular lesson.<br /><br />

                        Once you conclude that using instructional media will
                        help you achieve your explicit and/or implicit goals,
                        it is useful to apply the basic steps in the
                        instructional development process to choose and
                        apply the appropriate media. These basic steps include:

                                Reviewing instructional goals, objectives, audience and instructional strategy
