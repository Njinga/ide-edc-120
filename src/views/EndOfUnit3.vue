                                Before we end our discussion, let us remind ourselves of
                                some of the things we have discussed.  In this unit we have
                                noted that media to be used for instructional purposes should
                                not be selected just because it is available or because the teacher
                                prefers to use such media.  Instructional media should be selected
                                based on a given criteria.  That criterion should include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The instructional goal and instructional objectives;</li>
                                    <li>The audience characteristics;</li>
                                    <li>Nature of the subject matter;</li>
                                    <li>Essential media characteristics;</li>
                                    <li>Practical constraints;</li>
                                    <li>Teachers attitude towards media; and</li>
                                    <li>Appropriateness of the media.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify meme">
                                We went further and discussed the process for media
                                selection and ended the unit by discussing some of
                                the models that are used to inform us when selecting
                                instructional media.

                                We also discussed the concept of the systems approach.
                                We defined the systems approach as an overall approach that
                                involves tackling problems in a disciplined manner, yet
                                keeping priorities in mind. The sub-systems making up
                                the overall system are designed, fitted, checked and
                                operated so as to achieve the overall objective efficiently.
                                We noted that the systems approach is a problem-solving method
                                that helps to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Define the problem as clearly as possible;</li>
                                    <li>Analyze the problem and identify alternative solutions.</li>
                                    <li>Select the alternatives and develop the most viable solution mix.</li>
                                    <li>Implement and test the solution.</li>
                                    <li>Evaluate the effectiveness and worth of the solution.  </li>



                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify meme">
                                We went on to discuss the application of the systems approach to
                                media selection and use.  Here we noted that we have to be systematic
                                as we select media and materials. We have to be guided by some instructional
                                goal/objectives and the focus should be the learner.  We concluded the unit
                                by discussing the ASSURE model which is a procedural guide for planning
                                instruction that incorporates the use of media. We noted that use of media
                                has to be carried out in a systematic manner and the six procedural steps
                                have to be followed. These steps include;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Analyzing the learners</li>
                                    <li>Stating objectives</li>
                                    <li>Selecting methods, media and materials;</li>
                                    <li>Utilizing the media and materials;</li>
                                    <li>Requiring learner participation;</li>
                                    <li>Evaluating and revising the media and materials.  </li>
