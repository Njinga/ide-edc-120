                        In this unit, we discuss how to integrate instructional media into the
                        instructional process. In particular, we focus on the integration of
                        computer technology into the instructional process. As you may well be aware,
                        the computer has invaded most instructional situations and therefore we need
                        to embrace it to promote student learning.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        What you must not overlook is the fact that even if you use instructional media
                        during instruction this does not suggest that they are used effectively. You need
                        to know how to select media and integrate them into the lesson. Therefore, this unit
                        is meant to assist you as teachers to know how to integrate computer technology as well
                        as other media into teaching and learning.
