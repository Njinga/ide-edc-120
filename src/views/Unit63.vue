                                        The overhead projector (For more information see section 2.3.5 - Projected Media)
                                        is an equipment with a few components that require special maintenance procedures.
                                        However, you need to take a few basic precautions to ensure that the projector keeps
                                        putting on a bright performance. Some of the precautions include:
                                    </p>

                                                Keeping it as clean as possible. The horizontal stage which is made up of
                                                glass tends to gather dust and finger prints stick on. It should be cleaned
                                                regularly with lens tissue and proper lens cleaning solution. If possible,
                                                keep the glass surface covered in flannel cloth. This will help avoid
                                                scratching and dust accumulation.

                                                for projection should be protected in order to lengthen its life span since it is
                                                very expensive. The best way to lengthen the life of the lamp is to ensure that the
                                                projector is not left on for too long since overheating damages the lamp. Never
                                                touch the lamp when it is hot nor should you touch a new lamp with bare fingers
                                                since this shortens its life span.

                                            To get the best out of your overhead or computer projector, you need to know how to
                                            operate it the right way. Follow the following steps to operate an overhead projector:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Connect the power cord to the power outlet</li>
                                                <li>Turn the projector on</li>
                                                <li>Position the transparency on stage</li>
                                                <li>Adjust the projector to eliminate key stoning effect</li>
                                                <li>Focus the image.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                                            <i><kk>Key stone effect</kk></i> refers to a distortion of the image.
                                            The effect takes its name from the typical shape of a key-stoned image
                                            which is wide at the top and narrower at the bottom like a keystone.
                                            The key stone is caused by the position in which the projector is placed.
                                            If the projector is too high, too low or off either sides, a distortion of
                                            the image will occur. To remedy this situation, you can either  move the projector
                                            or the screen to bring the two into perpendicular relationship.
                                        </p>

                                            Once you have aligned the projector and screen, consider the distance between them.
                                            If the distance is too long, the image will spill over the edges of a screen and if the
                                            distance is too short, the image will not fill the screen properly.

                                                    If the image is too small, pull the projector back.

                                            You need to know what to do in such situations. Such problems that might prevent
                                            you from using the equipment are called <kk><i>trouble -shooting spots</i></kk>.For example:

                                            <ul>

                                                    When no power comes on after switching on the equipment.
                                                    You need to be sure that the projector is plugged into an electric
                                                    outlet and that there is electric power in that power point. At times
                                                    the equipment switch might be defective and you might have to replace it.

                                                    intended to extend the lives of the resources that you buy.
                                                    The lab rules and regulations should be posted prominently
                                                    and should apply to everyone who uses the lab  Such rules should
                                                    cover areas like:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>
                                                            No eating, drinking, or smoking should be allowed near equipment.

                                                        <li>Schedules for use should be strictly observed.</li>
                                                        <li>Problems with equipment should be reported promptly to designated personnel.</li>
                                                        <li>Lab users should show respect for others by maintaining appropriate noise levels.</li>
                                                    </ul><br /><br />
                                                </li>

                                                    <i>Maintenance needs and options. </i> Each teacher who uses the equipment needs training
                                                    in simple troubleshooting procedures such as making sure a printer is plugged in and on-line or
                                                    what to do when the computer display a message "a disk is unreadable".  Schools could minimize
                                                    repair problems if users follow good usage rules and conduct preventive maintenance procedures.
                                                    For the computer and other equipment, it is necessary to have a maintenance policy. For example,
                                                    establish a maintenance contract with an external supplier and set aside a maintenance budget.<br /><br />

                                                    <i>Securing the resources</i> Security is a separate but equally important maintenance issue
                                                    since loss of equipment from vandalism and theft is a common problem in schools.
                                                    Many of the computer accessories are very portable and can easily be stolen. A school
                                                    needs to devise a security system that would work for them to protect the equipment from
                                                    being stolen. <br /><br />

                                                    <i>Viruses: causes, prevention and cures. </i> Computer viruses are programmes written
                                                    specifically to cause damage or corrupt other programmes or information (Hansen & Koltes, 1992).
                                                    Like real viruses, these programmes can be passed to other programmes with which they come in contact.
                                                    For instance, they infect other computers by connecting one computer to another via telecommunications or by
                                                    inserting a disk containing the virus into a computer. Some viruses are carried into a computer system on
                                                    <kk><i>Trojan horses</i></kk> or attractive programmes designed for another purpose but which carry
                                                    instructions that get around protection codes (Lee, 1992). Some viruses are <i>worms</i> or programmes
                                                    designed specifically to run simultaneously with other programmes. Many different strains of viruses
                                                    plague computer systems and more are being generated.  The impact of the virus takes many forms. Some
                                                    viruses eat through data stored in a computer; others replicate copies of themselves in computer memory and
                                                    destroy files. Viruses have the general effect of tying up computer resources, frustrating users and wasting
                                                    valuable time.  To deal with the problem of viruses, Dormady (1991) recommends a four-point programme to minimize
                                                    the impact of viruses: establish good practices (scan systems and disks regularly, back up important data or files,
                                                    enforce safety policies (no unauthorized programmes), use virus management programmes.
